ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS meets the need for a comprehensive work of reference and deals with all important areas of linguistics and language studies 
The work makes a systematic effort to analyse and describe the current research and thinking in this field emphasizing the multidisciplinary nature of the subject 
The volumes are arranged thematically with each volume dedicated to a particular area of specialisation 
In planning the presentation of the Encyclopaedia the main consideration has been in selecting material which present particular theme or idea in a most comprehensive manner making the understanding of this subject much easier 
The main focus in the preparation of this work has been to make it useful for not only the specialist scholars and researchers but also for those wide range of potential users individuals and institutions in need of information in this diverse field 
Although the main thrust is on dealing with all major areas in the field of language and linguistics in as comprehensive a manner as possible by treating the core areas thoroughly the focus is also on including the new and emergent issues as well 
A significant feature of the Encyclopaedia is its interdisciplinary nature thus enough space is devoted to aspects of Sociology Social Development NAME NAME and Philosophy that impinge on Language 
The work is full of examples and illustrations and contains references and bibliography for each individual subjects being covered 
The comprehensiveness of the scope of this NAME is indicated by the vast amount of material included covering on one hand linguistics as a Science and on the other the Philosophy of linguistics 
It includes Structural linguistics trying to discover the rules of phonology morphology and syntax that predict how most speakers of the language talk 
The Historical Linguistic covers comparative analysis of cognates and grammar testing the notion that certain languages derive from common ancestral language 
The goals are to reconstruct the features of the Protolanguage to hypothesize how the off spring languages separated from each other and to establish its common origin 
The volume on NAME linguistics includes contributions from leaders in this field covering the concepts language development and functions in detail 
Development of language and its principles has been dealt with separately Recently NAME have begun to study variations in how people actually use language 
This type of linguistic study called NAME concerned with the ethnography of speaking is also dealt with in a separate volume 
The Encyclopaedia includes important contributions on the fast developing area of NAME by contributors who are working on the frontiers of the study of Language and Linguistics 
Apart from this the Encyclopaedia covers all major core areas in NAME NAME Development of Language NAME NAME Language and Social Development Problems and Methods In Linguistics and Strategies for Growth and Change 
Readable comprehensive and current the Encyclopaedia of Language and Linguistics is intended to serve as a standard reference work in this fast developing and changing discipline

<BODY>
Hi NAME continuing on from the last email I sent sorry about the delay my code is like a badly sown dress I pull NUM thread and spend the next few hours finding where I pulled it apart 
anyway here are the results as in the last email tungsten example might not result in increase in NAME although better than before 
question NUM however does improve when using a partial NAME here her is resolved to actress NAME and NAME through NAME her NAME resolution 
As there are very few NAME matches the direct substitution results in improvement for these cases 
Perhaps that is a further argument that combined with more complex system that incorporates NE the system could prefer equal ranking sentences in which the required NE occurs etc 
anyway table NUM again 
WEBSITE CHAR CHAR CHAR CHAR 
NAME the normal run NAME baseline antecedent manual replacement of sentences direct substitution automatic substitution of the pronoun for the antecedent in the original submission sentences 
NAME only related NAME elements NAME all elements 
The only example where the inner improved using the partial NAME was in the case of question NUM where the context was 
NAME NAME NAME mistress of NAME NAME NAME has been dead for almost NUM years but someone remembers 
Earlier this week a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in NAME Memorial Park 
Dear NAME you are still loved and missed read the accompanying note 

The original submission sentence read NAME NAME NAME mistress of NAME NAME NAME has been dead for almost NUM years but someone remembers 
however after pulling in actress NAME and NAME as all NUM had NAME arg the NAME selected the correct following sentence Earlier this week a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in NAME Memorial Park 
Earlier this week a fan left a red rose on actress NAME NAME mausoleum in NAME Memorial Park 
The real problem is that the shallow parsed NAME structures result in very few NAME elements so the NAME system is already based mainly upon NAME and CARG matches 
Therefore without NAME NAME representations to start with you are almost always only pulling in the antecedent itself 
hope that s ok I ll be home tomorrow morning if you need to call me

Past Presidents Politics
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Dear NAME 
While I have great respect both personal and professional for all our past presidents I regret that they have chosen to involve us as NAME in this matter 
Although the Presidents state further down in their letter that they are actually divided over the boycott issue and over NAME NAME s actions the first line of their letter reads We are writing in support of NAME NAME 
There is no doubt that this line will now receive wide citation in the campaign that supports NAME NAME both in her dispute with NAME and in her socalled personal boycott of NAME nationals 
It may not have been their intention but with this choice of emphasis the Presidents have given their name and ours for they say We may speak for many in our field because we are the recent past presidents of the Linguistics Association of NAME NAME to a campaign that says that it is right to limit individuals academic freedom if they have a particular nationality that it is correct to ban fellow scholars not due to their poor professional ethics or even on the basis of their political views but simply because of their place of work for those of you who do nt know both of NAME s boycottees are prominent proPalestinian human rights activists and that it is legitimate to put political blame for the actions taken by a government on individual fellow academics although this clearly only holds for NAME working in NAME I assume that none of us would dream of boycotting say Russian colleagues in protest against the flattening of NAME or American colleagues in protest against civilian casualties in NAME or Turkish colleagues in protest against the still existing ban on using NAME in public etc etc 
The Presidents even go on to say that we all agree that the discrimination by NAME against the NAME raises issues that are far more serious than the academic boycott and we regret the way that this issue is serving to divert attention I do not find that acting or arguing against boycotting individuals on the basis of their nationality rather than point of view or actions diverts either my attention or my energy away from engaging actively for peace in the Middle East 
Quite to the contrary as an NAME who has been activley engaged in dialogue with Palestinian friends and colleagues for over NUM decades now I feel that the only hope we have is to continue to make use of the freedoms we have as academics to meet and draft ideas for a better future and for life in peace and collaboration in a country which we must share 
Recall that the talks that had led to the NAME accords of the early NUM which NAME appears to oppose but which brought the only prospect of peace for over a century had been initiated by Palestinian and NAME academics meeting abroad defying a ban on contacts issued by hardliners on both sides 
If we restrict our own freedoms by banning contacts as NAME wants we are doing a service only to those whose aim is to separate our NUM peoples and to prevent them from ever reaching any common ground 
The Presidents raise concern over the potential infringement of NAME s liberty and say that Whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in a political action such as the boycott of the NAME academic community is not an issue for the employing organisation 
I strongly disagree 
NUM cannot pretend that we are talking about what an individual acdemic is doing in her free time 
The issue is rather which standards of academic practice are being set in the public life of our own academic community 
NAME s actions were not personal they were public gestures by a senior colleague aimed at changing the standards by which most of us operate 
As members of an academic association in this country it is our right and our duty to engage in a debate on where and how to set the standards of academic practice and behaviour 
It is also the right and duty of the leadership of any academic institution to engage in this debate 
The issue of whether or not it is acceptable to ban fellow academics based on their nationality or country of residence or place of work belongs to the code of practice of this academic community 
The issue of whether or not NAME discriminates the NAME or NAME the NAME or NAME the Catholics in NAME NAME or how to react to such discrimination does not belong to that code of practice and is beyond the remit of either the NAME or an academic institution like NAME 
In this last respect I very much regret the double standards that we seem to have in the NAME Last autumn at the NAME business meeting I proposed that we should react to the press reports concerning the NAME Secretary s statements on the use of mother tongue by immigrants in their homes 
Instead of deciding to act the assembly accepted a proposal that I should first establish what exactly had been said that I should then put together a report summarising current research on bilingualism in the family that I should then draft a reaction citing this research and then go on to poll the membership via this list and hope to come up with an agreed statement still to be issued before public opinion completely lost interest in the matter 
It turned out that NAME had not said what some of the press attributed to him 
Nonetheless his statement was ambiguous enough to deserve in my opinion a reaction clarifying that it is incorrect and improper to suggest a link between linguistic diversity and lack of modernity NAME s text suggested a link between acquiring English and modernity while addressing the alleged monolingualism of a large proportion of immigrants 
But it took many days to negotiate a text to present on this list and even the text that was agreed on was not for some reason passed on to the list but was substituted by a notice stripped of any evaluative content 
The NAME was not it seemed as interested in reacting to an issue situated on its own doorstep and which demanded its profesional expertise as much as it enjoys the inspiration of NAME NAME s ban them campaign 
Perhaps it s pity that the powers that determine events in NAME NAME are even less affected by what the NAME says than the British NAME Secretary

Dear NAME colleague This is to report that the recent past presidents of the NAME have written a letter to the press in support of a fellow linguist 
The letter was published in today s edition of the ORG 
The wording makes it clear that we wrote as individuals not on behalf of the NAME but we felt that NAME members should know about it because we mention the NAME 
The text of the letter as published follows 
NAME NAME 
We are writing in support of NAME NAME who is under investigation by the University of NAME Institute for Science and Technology for removing NUM NAME members from the editorial board of a journal she privately owns and publishes 
We may speak for many in our field because we are the recent past presidents of the Linguistics Association of NAME NAME 
We believe that NAME s treatment of NAME and subsequent publicity are disproportionate 
Although NAME denies considering dismissal NAME has been publicly reprimanded on the NAME website and an inquiry set in motion 
Like the rest of the academic community we are divided over whether or not the boycott of NAME institutions is justified and even more so over whether NAME was right to extend it to individual NAME scholars 
However we all agree that the discrimination by NAME against the NAME raises issues that are far more serious than the academic boycott and we regret the way that this issue is serving to divert attention 
We are also concerned at the potential infringement of NAME s liberty by NAME and at the precedent this would set 
Whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in a political action such as the boycott of the NAME academic community is not an issue for the employing organisation

volume 
I hope and assume that you are currently revising your paper so I feel it makes sense for you to distribute it as soon as you have a revised version that people could look at 
I ll leave you each to decide on the best way to do this but would ask firstly that you undertake to distribute your paper in some way for instance by sending round an attachment 
This list contains only papers that I consider to be related in some way NUM in total so I ve already taken some of the work out of the procedure 
Secondly I ask that you undertake to look at the contributions so received and refer to them as NAME this volume where there are interesting relevant points of overlap or controversy agreement or dispute 
Here I summarise briefly the contents key words of the papers on the list with apologies to anyone I ve misrepresented please let me know

Re how to talk about a distinction in text mining
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
NAME 
In the terminology of the NAME NAME NAME NAME program WEBSITE NAME NUM relations are termed explicit and NAME NUM relations are termed implicit 
See the site documentation for more details 
NAME 
In text mining I find it useful to distinguish between these NUM ways in which text can carry information about real world entities 
NAME NUM 
The information about the entity is present as a natural language utterance in the text eg Mrs 
NAME lives in NAME 
NAME NUM 
The textual record is linked to the person and that link is critical for using the text as a source of information about the real world entity 
For instance Mrs NAME in an email to a social newsgroup use various vocabulary make references to locations etc that would lead one to believe that the author of the message lives in NAME 
The distinction is not sharp and the same piece of text can obviously carry information in both ways 
Linguistically perhaps the difference just boils down to resolving the personal pronoun NUM using the Sender field of the email rather than a name in the text 
In practice however I find the NUM to be very different 
In particular NAME NUM is much more susceptible to text classification approaches 
One assumes the whole document is about the person to which it is linked and you classify the person by classifying the document 
In NAME NUM however you have to be much more serious about the NAME since perhaps only that single sentence talks about the entity you re interested in and may do some in a way where the linguistic structure makes a lot of difference 
Anyway I m trying to think of a good pair of terms to talk about NAME NUM vs NAME NUM 
NAME vs NAME 
Third person vs First person 
Any suggestions

Hi all NUM absolutely second NAME s post 
In fact I have issues in principle with anonymization as this will obviously affect phonological aspects of the corpus due to the very anonymization

I guess that this means bad language I assume it does not rel ate to anonymization issues as they are covered in NAME s point NUM If this is about bleeping out words in corpora should nt we encourage NAME not to do this 
Surely we want corpora to contain uncensored speech

Re word simplification project for NAME NAME

NUM Analyse the CIDE NAME definitions for the target verbs to find the candidate substitutable terms 
I am not sure whether this will be too difficult or not 
The idea would be that if you had a definition like CIDE s 
extinguish to stop a fire or light burning 
you d want to get something like 
stop NAME burning 
I suspect this will get quite interesting for example the definition of douse is 
to stop a fire or light burning or shining esp 
by putting water on it or covering it with something 
so he ll need to decide whether or not to get rid of parentheticals and more importantly whether he s dousing a light or fire 
interestingly the definition of extinguish does nt have the or shining bit in it 
I suspect paraphrasing will only help when the paraphrase is reasonably short 
Again NAME might be in a good position to decide on how short 
NAME seems to be the opposite of what the summarisation crowd call content conflation 
Example from NAME NUM 
NAME defeated NAME NUM 
It was a tight game where the lead kept changing can be conflated to generate NAME outlasted NAME NUM 
not quite sure how she does that though 
definitely not from the cide definition of outlast

The NAME sources for the NAME and NAME are at NAME the versions on usr groups nltools lingo are generally out of date

A readonly account has now been introduced which allows this

cvs CHAR pserver EMAIL NAME checkout erg 
or 
cvs CHAR pserver EMAIL NAME checkout lkb 
You can then do cvs update etc as normal though you ca nt check any changes in 
If you do things that you think ought to be incorporated into the main version let me know 
It would probably be a good idea to let me know before putting a substantial amount of work into anything even if you re planning to keep it private because the NAME in particular is changing quite a lot at the moment

Well done the presidents 
NAME NAME 
Dear NAME colleague This is to report that the recent past presidents of the NAME have written a letter to the press in support of a fellow linguist 
The letter was published in today s edition of the NAME 
The wording makes it clear that we wrote as individuals not on behalf of the NAME but we felt that NAME members should know about it because we mention the NAME 
The text of the letter as published follows 
NAME NAME 
We are writing in support of NAME NAME who is under investigation by the University of NAME Institute for Science and Technology for removing NUM NAME members from the editorial board of a journal she privately owns and publishes 
We may speak for many in our field because we are the recent past presidents of the Linguistics Association of NAME NAME 
We believe that NAME s treatment of NAME and subsequent publicity are disproportionate 
Although NAME denies considering dismissal NAME has been publicly reprimanded on the NAME website and an inquiry set in motion 
Like the rest of the academic community we are divided over whether or not the boycott of NAME institutions is justified and even more so over whether NAME was right to extend it to individual NAME scholars 
However we all agree that the discrimination by NAME against the NAME raises issues that are far more serious than the academic boycott and we regret the way that this issue is serving to divert attention 
We are also concerned at the potential infringement of NAME s liberty by NAME and at the precedent this would set 
Whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in a political action such as the boycott of the NAME academic community is not an issue for the employing organisation

NAME undertook the Diploma in Computer Science last academic year 
She chose a project on junk email filtering which I supervised 
She worked hard at the project improving her programming and statistical skills and demonstrated considerable initiative taking the project well beyond the core component I had specified 
She showed that she was able to plan and undertake a significant software implementation and design and evaluate experiments assessing the quality of her system 
She is quiet and a little diffident but I found her very pleasant to work with and as time passed she relaxed and became more confident 
I have little doubt that she would fit in well into your office and work diligently and effectively

Hi NAME 
How are you 
I thought it was well past time I wrote you a quick email to tell you what has been happening down here 
NAME was spent writing up though not enough writing since I had to get an extension till the new year 
I still have a lot to do and there s only NUM weeks left but I will hopefully be done soon 
Submission day is January th which coincides with the start of my new job here in NAME 
I mentioned NAME NAME to you when I came to NAME for the interview 
Shortly after the NAME visit she mentioned an advert for a job and encouraged me to apply 
It sounded like a very interesting project certainly very different to what I do at the moment The hypothesis is that encouraging children to reflect on the double meanings in jokes leads to an increase in their text comprehension 
Pilot studies have supported this 
I get to work in the schools with the kids as well which is one of the very positive aspects to the project 
The name of the project is NAME 
My role in it is somewhat unsurprisingly the techie person I write the software and the website 
How is getting the course online going 
I am still planning on developing NAME come the new year 
I hope you and your family are keeping well please send them my regards and season s greetings 
Take care

Dear all Interactive websites for teaching NAME and corpus linguistics 
Do you know of any neat websites that could be used to demo and teach about NAME and corpus linguistics 
I am surveying what is available either produced for teaching or which like some product demos could play a useful role in teaching 
My goals are both for input to our MSc NAME NAME and NAME and as a small research project into the web and pedagogy with ref to NAME corpus linguistics 
Feedback from students and teachers about how well the sites supported student learning are of particular interest 
Items of most interest are those that do not have access restrictions do not involve installing anything and will make sense to decent linguistics majors eg not too specialist 
Examples items already on my list include 
NAME Research NAME NAME s parser dependency database corpusbased word clusters etc WEBSITE NAME NAME and NAME NAME s OpenMind page for doing manual NAME WEBSITE NAME WEBSITE

TITLE NAME task versus Filtering Routing task No You NAME Just Take Your Pick 
This talk focuses on NUM aspect of documentquery duality 
In this talk duality refers to the fact that given a data set one might arbitrarily choose to perform either queryoriented estimation or documentoriented estimation 
I explain that this duality is not a choice but a problem for almost any conceivable approach to parameter estimation in NAME and it is rarely adequately addressed 
Early Language NAME efforts made this problem worse in some respects but a consensus is emerging about how to solve the problem 
I will present a probabilistic solution whose principles can be adapted to a wide variety of NAME models ie even nonprobabilistic NUM 
Experiments using the proposed solution show that at least in NUM respect queries are as informative as documents are contrary to a widely held belief 
There are also important implications for construction of NAME data sets

I believe this information should go onto the web at some point when the data set is reliable enough

We are going to be very shortstaffed in Reception over the summer 
We are loosing NAME NAME to another job in June and NAME NAME goes on maternity leave at about the same time 
This is good for them but makes life difficult for us 
It means that NAME NAME will be on her own until we can recruit a replacement for NAME 
NAME works parttime so it is inevitable that Reception will be closed for considerable periods probably most of the afternoons and all day on Fridays 
Even before NAME and NAME leave there will be days when staff holidays cause shortterm difficulties so from today NAME may be closed from time to time

Dear Dr NAME 
I am a visiting postdoctoral Mathematics researcher at the NAME institute for Mathematics in NAME NAME 
I would like to apologize for sending you unsolicited email 
If I had not felt myself in desperate need of your guidance I would not have ventured to do so 
At the moment my topic of research is mainly in Pure Mathematics 
Specifically the subject of my Ph NAME has been in Algebraic Topology 
I received my Ph NAME degree at NAME University in NUM 
I am now a little more than NUM years beyond my Ph NAME and increasingly I feel that I do not really want to continue in Pure mathematics 
In fact I would very much like to move into the area of language processing 
This subject seems to encompass all NUM of my interests languages logic and computers 
In particular I am interested in modeling the human language acquisition process via computer programming and mathematical analysis 
I believe my mathematical background will enable me to quickly acquire the necessary computational background 
This leaves me to concentrate on the formal study of linguistics 
In this light I thought a good fist step would be to take the NAME NAME 
course in NAME NAME offered in your department and perhaps continue onto a second research degree 
However I am told that I can not be awarded a second higher degree from NAME because of the Ph NAME I have already obtained 
is this true 
I am writing to you in the hopes that you might have suggestions or advice on possible opportunities for me to do research in your department interact with the people in your department and attend the courses offered in relation to the NAME NAME 
degree I have mentioned above 
I would be grateful for your help 
Yours faithfully

CORPUS LINGUISTICS FOR KOREAN LANGUAGE LEARNING TEACHING SUMMER INSTITUTE 
June July NUM NUM WEBSITE 
Corpus linguistics studies take advantage of the existence of large collections of language production written or spoken language in order to investigate a language 
Foreign language pedagogy is now beginning to see new possibilities for recent advances in corpus linguistics to improve language teaching and learning 
Readily available Koreanlanguage corpora and easytouse tools can now be used on the spot in a language teaching context by teachers and learners without extensive training in computational linguistics and studies of linguistic features can be tailored to specific pedagogic context and learning requirements 
The NAME NAME Institute workshop Corpus Linguistics for Korean Language Learning and NAME will acquaint participants with the basic concepts of corpus linguistics including corpus construction and NAME concordancing frequency counts and ranks grammatical tagging and related concepts 
Participants will learn how to access Korean corpora and how to use the available computer programs for Korean corpus analysis 
The workshop will outline techniques for the teacher to use in materials preparation and curriculum design and for the individual learner to use in exploring meaning structure and use in Korean 
In the second part of the workshop participants will engage in individual projects chosen with their own learning goals in mind

NUM CONTENTTYPE TEXT PLAIN NAME CONTENTTYPE 
MESSAGEBODY Hi NAME 
It appears that the emails you send do not have a NAME field in their headers 
Without the contenttype field it is unclear how to interpret the content and thus for safety sake my system will remove such emails from the corpus 
I cannot assume that emails that do nt have contenttype fields are always in plain text as this is not the case with some of the emails I have already collected 
This means that you would get a blank response from the NAME EMAIL thing 
In this case I added a contenttype field specifying plain text so you should have got a reply anyway 
Have you got any idea why your email prog would leave out the contenttype field 
Do many others use the same email client

NAME Document filtering tasks models and implementation 
Speaker NAME NAME NAME Research 
NAME 
Much information retrieval research revolves around a canonical model of a search task a user issuing a query to a temporarily static document collection and being presented with a ranked list of documents with perhaps a feedback loop 
This model informs many aspects of the work 
the kinds of theoretical approach taken many implementation issues including the design of efficient fastresponse systems the measurement of effectiveness and the qualitative testing of systems 
However we may take a number of different views of the information task itself and the user context in which that task occurs 
NUM alternative is represented by the filtering task as defined for the NAME exercise 
Here filtering is seen as a contentbased adaptive task applied to an incoming stream of documents involving user needs represented by profiles 
In this talk I will explore the nature of this task and some of the ways in which it must be treated differently from the canonical model 
I will address both conceptual and implementation issues and discuss some experimental results from NAME

Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION 
NAME editors NAME NAME EMAIL NAME NAME EMAIL 
The process of automatically determining the meanings of words word sense disambiguation NAME is an important stage in language understanding 
It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation information retrieval mono and crosslingual corpus analysis summarization and document navigation 
The importance of NAME has been acknowledged since the s and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of NAME an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision recall comparison of participating systems which has been run twice to date 
The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible 
This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on handcrafted disambiguation rules 
This special issue of the Journal of NAME NAME due for publication in July NUM is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation 
Papers are invited on all aspects of NAME research and especially on 
Combinations of methods and knowledge sources 
Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information 
How should they be combined 
Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources 
Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another 
Evaluation of NAME systems 
Which metrics are most informative and would new NUM be useful 
Can NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task for example parsing 
Can evaluations using different data sets corpora and lexical resources be compared 
Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods 
Sense distinctions and sense inventories 
How do these affect NAME 
How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the NAME task 
Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text 
What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done 
The effect of NAME on applications 
To what extent does NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval 
What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications 
What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes 
Minimising the need for handtagged data 
NAME text is expensive and difficult to obtain while untagged text is plentiful and effectively limitless 
What techniques can be used to make use of untagged text would weakly semisupervised learning algorithms be useful 
What use can be made of parallel text 
Can untagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text

NAME Group The Next Stage
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Hi 
As might have been very correctly observed by several of you at different stages although it is a small one which should logically help our NAME group lacks some of the characteristics that would justify that appellation we know little or nothing about each other s research methods sometimes even interests 
This is something I know some of us have at some point felt sorry about 
Luckily NAME and NAME have now decided to give it a try 
They asked me to organize something that would allow everyone to get the chance to explain what they are doing on an informal basis 
However for the aim to be reached it is important that everyone of us takes part in the event 
Attendance is therefore highly recommended not to say obligatory 
The plan given that we are NUM of us is to held NUM afternoons at a few weeks interval 
All members of the group would give a NUM min talk NUM on each afternoon 
Rather than being about results of the research only these talks should mostly be a short description of current research methods and tools used and designed problems met ie points that can be useful for the entire group and about which some useful feedback or ideas could be given by other members of the group 
After each talk NUM min would indeed be allocated for questions and or comments 
After the talks we would then do something together and NAME has already offered to host a pizza drinks gettogether at his place for one of the afternoons 
Everything is possible and if you ve got any idea let me know 
Dates for the NUM afternoons have been already suggested 
NAME NUM or NAME NUM June NAME NUM or NAME NUM July 
We want to make sure that everyone could attend 
Therefore please send me your comments about these dates if you definitely ca nt make NUM or several of them 
I think this is a wonderful idea NAME going for 
I m sure we can make something of it provided everyone puts a little goodwill into it 
I ll be coordinating these events so please send me all comments directly 
If you think this is not the best way of doing it feel free to send any other idea as well 
Cheers

SYMPOSIUM AIMS 
This NAME symposium follows upon the growing awareness from academia industry and research communities of the importance of evolvability tentatively defined as the capacity of populations to exhibit adaptive heritable NAME partcular the symposium focuses on the relation between evolvability and sensor and effector evolution 
The symposium aims to encourage a dialogue between various workers in areas that might benefit from a possible common framework addressing evolvability and sensor effector evolution 
The symposium addresses NUM aspects that are believed to be central in understanding fundamental biological mechanisms like information information discovery acquisition processing and transmission both on the level of populations and individuals these mechanisms are evolvability and sensor evolution 
NAME 
Darwinian evolution characterized by heritable variation and selection is not by itself sufficient to account for the capacity to vary and inherent phenotypic expressions of fitness 
Rigidity of genotypephenotype mappings as often used in evolutionary computation constrains the dynamics of evolution to a small space of possible biological or artificial systems 
Openended evolution is not possible under such constraints 
NAME by itself cannot fully explain the advant of genetic systems the flexible genotypephenotype mappings heritable fitness 
This presents a challenge both to biologists seeking to understand the capacity of life to evolve and to computer scientists who seek to harness biologicallike robustness and openness in the evolution of artificial systems 
To what extent does evolvability require a population of discrete individuals on which to act 
How can higher levels of sensory individuality arise 
NAME has been variously defined as the genome s ability to produce adaptive variants when acted on by the genetic system NAME NAME NUM as the capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation NAME NAME NUM and as characterized by evolutionary watersheds opening the floodgates to future evolution such as segmentation and body plans NAME NUM 
On the other hand unconstrained or inappropriately constrained variability and change can lead to lack of stability cancer nonheritability of fitness lack of evolutionary power and so on 
NAME NAME 
In natural evolution one finds impressive examples of the principle of exploiting and creating new sensory channels and information they carry 
NAME tactile auditory and visual but also eg electrical and even magnetic senses have evolved in a multitude of variants often utilizing organs not originally intended for the purpose they serve at present 
Biologically evolving systems are able to adaptively construct their own hardware and software 
The new sensors create new ways of giving meaning to and interpreting the world 
Many biological sensors reach a degree of structural and functional complexity and of efficiency which is envied by engineers creating manmade sensors 
Sensors enable animals to survive in dynamic and unstructured environments to perceive and react appropriately to features in the biotic and abiotic environment including members of the own species as well as predators and prey 
NAME artificial sensors for hardware or software systems suggests a similar approach taken for generating lifelike behaviour namely using evolutionary techniques in order to explore design spaces and generate sensors which are specifically adapted with respect to environmental and other fitness related constraints 
The creation of channels of sensory input and effectory output lead to higher evolvability as new relevance criteria are developed that confer a survival advantage to future offspring

TITLE Automated Applicationlevel Checkpointing of NAME Programs 
Recent trends in supercomputing are leading us towards NUM new types of supercomputing platforms large arrays of commodity parts and grid computing 
While both platforms promise to be more cost effective than their monolithic predecessors they suffer from increased failure rates as high as one failed processor a day due their size and the fact that they are not manufactured by a single entity 
At the same time many computational tasks like protein folding and materials science simulations are becoming larger taking weeks months or even a year to compute 
In short program runtimes are greatly exceeding the meantime to failure of their platforms 
Our work deals with automatic methods for enabling applications to survive hardware faults 
We have developed a way of recording program state at the applicationlevel by using a preprocessor to get the program save its own state 
Furthermore we have developed and implemented a distributed coordination protocol that arranges checkpoints from individual processors into a consistent global recovery line 
When any processors fail everybody else can roll back to their most recent checkpoint and resume their computation with very little work lost

Re Multilingual text categorisation
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
I use the CLEF Corpora that I have managed for the problem of Multilingual Text categorisation 
I do not know if my choise of this corpus will affect the result 
Note that it is very difficult to obtain corpora for this task 
NAME 
Original Message From NAME NAME EMAIL NAME 
What corpus are you using for your experiments 
I think that the second solution will work well if you are using a general corpus 
However one of the problem I have observed when using NAME in other domains like medicine or biology is that the translation of domain specific terms will be very poor 
In this case you will need have a domain specific multilingual dictionary that could be included in the NAME system 
NAME NAME 
On Thursday NUM April NUM NUM NUM am NAME NAME wrote 
Dear NAME 
For some days I have sent a message to ask whether you know references in categorization of multilingual texts 
I thank all the people who answered my question 
I asked this question because I have been interested on this subject for some months 
According to the answers received I can say that there are not works on this subject compared to works in the NAME crosslanguage information retrieval 
The problem that I treat is as follows 
Suppose that we have some corpora in several languages 
The subjects of these corpora are comparable 
Each text of these corpora is label by NUM or more classes subjects 
It is about sotries of newspapers in several languages which cover different subjects like Conflict in NAME Conflict of Interests in NAME NAME NAME NAME Destruction of Ukrainian nuclear weapons NAME American car industry The objective is to use the techniques of texts categorization on these corpora 
Our hope is to be able to know the subject of each new text whatever its language 
At the beginning I had NUM possible solutions suppose that NAME NUM CHAR where CHAR is the number of languages and NAME NUM NAME where Cli is the number of classes for the language NAME 
NUM the first solution is to learn a model for each language thus if I have NUM languages I must learn NUM models NUM for each then in the phase of classification for each new text one identifies its language and applies the model of this language on it 
This is the simplest solution and the most direct but this solution is limited because it supposes to have sufficient quantity of texts for each class and for each language and it require CHAR learning 
NUM The second solution is to learn on only NUM language NAME as we do usually and then for each new text one identifies its language and one translates it by an automatic translator into the language NAME and then one applies the learned model of the language NAME on the translated text 
I made experiments on the NUM approaches and according to obtained results the second solution perfomes well 
Therefore the introduction of machine translation in the process of categorization helps to recognize the subject of a text 
All comments helps or ideas are welcome

NAME NAME 
I m working on this topic as part of my Ph NAME thesis on NAME NAME Signals from NAME 
In this work I have shown that the position of words in the text is more successful at recognizing topic words than nonpositional word statistics usually used in NAME 
By topic words I mean words that are generally used in discussin CHAR the topic 
For example Belief Networks and NAME NAME are topic phrases for Artificial Intelligence 
Note however that this work focuse CHAR on words only at this stage 
Given a training set for a topic CHAR our approach is used to extract topic words for NAME Thus CHAR is represented by this set of topic words 
When the system is introduced with some new document CHAR it uses CHAR s topic words to evaluate the intensity of discussion on topic CHAR in the new document 
The more CHAR topic words there are and the more condensed they are the more intense the discussion at that point in NAME

Hi 
I am want to explore some other way to classify and or understand texts 
I have some experience in wordsoccurrence statistic techniques but I ju st want more 
In fact I am looking for works about algorithms able to learn grammar basics phrase structure or just words relationships location in text common topic 
The idea is to get an algorithm able to read a NAME CHAR extract some topics just in time and even predict what will be read in order to get an opinion about the text 
I would prefer some nonnaturallanguageprocessing as long as animals can learn a language without grammar knowledge It seems 
I know that goes away from classic text classification 
Does it already exist something going in this direction 
Every weird inputs are welcome SMILEY

I have NUM points resulting from a brief conversation with NAME

will NAME NAME be a founder 
NUM This is important with respect to tax 
Would the shares be deemed to have been issued later with a NAME liability 
The precise time of the issue of shares to NAME NAME is critical and if the issue is postmoney the valuation could leave us with a NAME liability 
NUM 
would a side agrement and no CHAR CHAR agreement until funding is raised be constitutional 
I ve not dealt with a case like the one proposed and wonder whether the savings in not duplicating the work of NUM CHAR hs agreements premoney and postmoney is not outweighed by the sort of issues indicated above

Re NAME NAME recall NUM point for NAME NAME classifier
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
EMAIL said 
Thanks for your reply 
My main concern with this type of thresholding is that this is no longer a NAME classifier because the NAME decision rule assigns each example to the class with the highest score posterior probability regardless of the absolute values of the scores 
In fact it is still a Naive NAME classifier though with an altered class prior 
For example if the class NUM likelihood is twice the class NUM likelihood then an even prior NUM for both classes will yield CHAR NUM label since the posterior for the class NUM will be larger 
But a prior that weights class NUM sufficiently heavily eg NUM for class NUM NUM for class NUM will yield CHAR NUM label for the document 
If you look at logprobabilities NAME NAME is simply a linear classifier and the class prior is the bias or threshold term

WEBSITES 
Workshop website WEBSITE 
NAME website WEBSITE 
WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION 
NAME expressions NAME include a large range of linguistic phenomenon such as phrasal verbs eg add up nominal compounds eg telephone box and institutionalized phrases eg salt and NAME and they can be syntactically and or semantically idiosyncratic in nature 
NAME are used frequently in everyday language usually to express precisely ideas and concepts that cannot be compressed into a single word 
A considerable amount of research has been devoted to this subject both in terms of theory and practice but despite increasing interest in idiomaticity within linguistic research there is still a gap between the needs of NAME and the descriptive tradition of linguistics 
Owing to the lack of adequate resources to identify and treat NAME properly they pose a real challenge for NAME 
Most realworld applications tend to ignore NAME or address them simply by listing 
However it is clear that successful applications will need to be able to identify and treat them appropriately 
This particularly applies to the many applications which require some degree of semantic processing eg machine translation questionanswering summarisation generation 
In recent years there has been a growing awareness in the NAME community of the problems that NAME pose and the need for their robust handling 
A considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area some within large research projects dedicated to NAME eg the NAME Expression Project 
There is also a growing interest in NAME in projects focused on tasks such as parsing eg Robust Accurate NAME NAME NAME and word sense disambiguation eg MEANING NAME NAME NAME Language Technologies which are required by realworld applications 
Previous workshops on NAME have focused on certain NAME types notably collocations terminology and named entities 
There are however further subtypes of NAME which are highly relevant for NAME tasks but which have not to date received specific attention 
NUM example are lexicalised non or semicompositional NAME which raise specific issues for applications which require semantic interpretation 
TARGET AUDIENCE 
This workshop is intended to bring together NAME researchers working on all areas of NAME 
The objective is to summarise what has been achieved in the area to establish common themes between different approaches and to discuss future trends with particular emphasis on addressing the problems that different NAME sub types pose for realworld NAME applications 
AREAS OF INTEREST 
Papers are invited on but not limited to the following topics 
Theoretical research on NAME 
NAME taxonomies classifications and databases 
Corpus based analysis of NAME 
Crosslingual analysis of NAME types use and behaviour 
Methods for identification and extraction of NAME machine learning statistical example or rulebased or hybrid 
Evaluation of NAME extraction methods 
Integration of NAME data into grammars and NAME applications eg machine translation and generation 
NAME NAME or NAME types pose for NAME applications and solutions proposed 
Papers can cover NUM or more of these areas

Hierarchical Autonomous Resonant Primitives An Evolutionary Principle 
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 
Our aim is to understand the principles which allow the design of robust 
robot controllers using artificial evolution 
To do so we seek to distil the critical elements of natural evolution and apply these principles to 
our own ends 
Having examined the developmental literature we hypothesise that evolution acts incrementally and compositionally to construct systems consisting of hierarchical autonomous resonant primitives NAME 
This is what is developed 
How these HARPs are developed is a related but distinct question which we then address 
Evidence is presented from evolutionary computation developmental neuroscience and complex systems research to support the validity of this reformulation 
The existence of NAME has been alluded to in NAME s nearlydecomposable systems in work on the evolution of modularity and in recent work subsumed under the term dynamical hierarchies 
We hypothesise that degeneracy canalization and biological complexity exist as a consequence of the existence of HARPs 
We hypothesise that HARPs can be utilized to help solve the competing conventions problem so facilitating effective recombination 
We hypothesise that HARPs underlie the massive ontogenic reorganizability seen in nervous systems in genomes themselves and indeed in any biological system and so confers ontogenic robustness which facilitates increased evolvability 
Evolutionary approaches to neural network design have rarely utilized HARPs and this review seeks to demonstrate their existence and sets the 
background for a research program to investigate them

This timescale will enable those whose teaching depends on these applications to check that they work correctly and to allow for any necessary remedial action to be taken before the start of the NAME NAME 
Those requesting software whether new applications or upgrades to existing software are asked to consider the budgetary implications of their requests for themselves and sites 
Those teaching over the period of the Long Vacation should note that the installation of new versions of NAME software may have implications for them

The educational psychologist s report recommends that NAME be allowed to submit his essay NUM weeks after the exams but I do nt want him trying to do that at the same time as the project 
What do you think about giving him time after the end of the course for the essay 
The degree committee meeting is currently set for September NUM as long as we have it marked by then I do nt see any structural problem 
We could ask him to submit by eg August th 
NAME says she can NAME it 
I strongly suspect we ll need to give him extra time for the project too since this is nt mentioned in the report I probably ought to discuss it with the college and perhaps ask the psychologist for recommendations 
The college and Board of examinations have agreed a procedure for him taking the exams over NUM days 
The report recommends that he should not be penalised in the exam for spelling and or grammar mistakes 
I do nt imagine that any of us would be inclined to do this anyway but I will ask NAME to put a note in with the scripts etc 
I have a copy of a fax of the report we ll get a proper copy tomorrow or Friday in the post 
He has a number of identifiable problems most seriously that he has impaired auditory working memory this is leading to comprehension problems 
I will attempt to take account of this when supervising his project

Re Multilingual text categorisation
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
What is the problem precisely 
If it is to categorise the language of documents then I can see that this is a good approach 
However if it is to apply a set of subject categories to multilingual documents then obtaining suitable training data will be a more difficult problem 
You would need a sample of documents about each topic in each language 
NAME NAME NAME Open University NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NUM NUM NUM NUM WEBSITE 
Both language modeling papers I listed mentioned a simple technique for obtaining training data using a standard search engine such as NAME ie you can simply specify the language of the document to be searched for 
NAME 
NAME NAME NAME EMAIL 
By Multilingual NAME NAME I mean the problem of automatically assigning a category to a document whatever it is the language 
The suggested approach build separate language models for the different languages supposes to have a sufficient quantity of texts in each language and for each category to be able to learn a model 
In the real life this 
is not always true 
NAME 
At NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM you wrote 
I suppose if you meant applying text categorization methods to a multilingual set of documents then you could just build separate language models for the different languages using the same approach as mentioned in the above papers

Many thanks NAME 
I ll put these points to the NAME 
I know there is a strong view that the time between the WShops and publication of the SI should be short as possible without compromising standards 
As to number of papers my guess would be possibly as many NUM given the status of the meetings but we could simply restrict it to the NUM or NUM for NUM issue 
Otherwise all seems well

This workshop clearly falls within the scope of NAME and my initial reaction to your email is very positive 
To move forwards we need more information 
CHAR We will need the names of the guest editors to be appointed preferably NUM 
CHAR We need a draft schedule to publication so that we can identify the best issue to allocate to you 
I assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop 
You then need to give them time to produce the full paper send it out to referees allow revisions final review and accept 
This looks to me like th quarter NUM or st quarter NUM 
CHAR A single issue of NAME will accommodate NUM or NUM papers 
To accommodate more we would have to make it a double issue 
How many papers do you anticipate accepting 
If you can answer the above then the editors can make a final decision 
Note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular submissions to NAME 
Each accepted paper must have been reviewed by NUM independent reviewers 
The guest editors make the accept reject decision but one of the regular NAME editors is assigned to assist in the process probably me in this case

Hi NAME 
I believe that we approached you some time ago to investigate the possibility of a special issue of the Computer Speech Language journal on NAME NUM The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop I ve attached the draft NAME with more details 
Given that the NAME NAME NUM Workshop will be held in conjunction with NAME NUM we might want to consider including papers from both workshops in the special issue I recall you being favorable to our query although we had not yet formulated a real proposal 
Can you still accommodate us 
If so under what parameters conditions eg turn around time page count page size guest editor CHAR 
Are you also working under NAME van der NAME and if so would you like me to ask her about this 
We published a special issue of NAME journal using an expedited roundrobin review process on the NAME Speaker NAME NAME NUM that was published as almost NUM NAME NAME pages in a triple volume within only a few months 
I think the quality of the papers was reasonably good although we might have erred on accepting a few too many papers for the special issue and disrupting NAME s page quotas for that year 
There was a special issue of Speech Communication on an NAME predecessor workshop but that took much longer too long to publish 
I ve included an excerpt from some discussions on these pros and cons and would like to know if you agree with this assessment especially with respect to NAME

Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION 
NAME editors NAME NAME NAME University EMAIL NAME NAME University of NAME EMAIL 
The process of automatically determining the meanings of words word sense disambiguation NAME is an important stage in language understanding 
It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation information retrieval mono and crosslingual corpus analysis summarization and document navigation 
The usefulness of NAME has been acknowledged since the s and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of NAME an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision recall comparison of participating systems which has been run twice to date 
The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible 
This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on handcrafted disambiguation rules 
This special issue of NAME NAME due for publication in NUM is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation 
Papers are invited on all aspects of NAME research and especially on 
Combinations of methods and knowledge sources 
Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information 
How should they be combined 
Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources 
Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another 
Evaluation of NAME systems 
Which metrics are most informative and would new NUM be useful 
Can NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task for example parsing 
Can evaluations using different data sets corpora and lexical resources be compared 
Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods 
Sense distinctions and sense inventories 
How do these affect NAME 
How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the NAME task 
Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text 
What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done 
The effect of NAME on applications 
To what extent does NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval 
What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications 
What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes 
Minimising the need for handtagged data 
Handtagged text is expensive and difficult to obtain while untagged text is plentiful and effectively limitless 
What techniques can be used to make use of untagged text would weakly semisupervised learning algorithms be useful 
What use can be made of parallel text 
Can untagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text

Hi NAME 
Along side my report I ve been doing some work with NAME 
I grabbed the opportunity to get her software working with mine because when I tried before she was quite busy 
We ve been looking at the contribution a NAME makes to the speed of learning 
We can run experiments first using my learner on it s own and then with the with the feedback from NAME s NAME module 
Looks like we ll get quite a speed up in learning 
Thought this might be interesting in terms of empricism vs nativism showing we can learn without a large amounts of innate knowledge but it it takes much longer and possibly too long in terms of the cut off 
We have just noticed there is a conference bootla CHAR think where this work might fit quite nicely 
Do you think it would a good place to submit something 
I can ask my college for funds

Re NAME overhead projectors
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
I am at a loss to understand the recent allegations that there is a shortage of projectors in the lecture theatres 
OK one of these were me 
The first time the projector had been moved from the projector stand why and placed in the cupboard underneath 
Now I know this I can look there but at the time I just struggled on with one 
The second time some kind soul had removed one into the preparation room 
Again it s simple when one knows all the places they might have been hidden but at the time it s easy to believe the NUM has been playing up and has been removed thought 
I checked this morning and there are 
In NAME NUM projectors the correct number 
In NAME NUM projectors NUM more than should be there 
It was nt me who borrowed one but I can understand the I m about to lecture and need a second projector but one has disappeared crisis 
As a metacomment to the current issue I suspect the NAME projectors get moved because someone using the NAME projectors finds they get in the way 
A really nice longterm solution is to arrange that the NUM desks on which the projectors sit just have a camera above or below so that images written in realtime can be projected onto the NUM NAME projectors

NAME RESEARCH LECTURE 
SPEAKER NAME NAME INSTITUTION Interview Talk HOST NAME NAME DATE Tuesday March NUM NUM TIME NUM NUM NUM NUM PLACE NAME Theatre NAME Research Ltd NUM CHAR CHAR NAME Avenue Off NAME Road NAME TITLE NAME A Variational Inference Engine for NAME NAME 
In recent years variational methods have become a popular tool for approximate inference and learning in a wide variety of probabilistic models with applications ranging from bioinformatics to machine vision 
For each new application however it is currently necessary first to derive the variational update equations and then to implement them in applicationspecific code 
Each of these steps is both time consuming and error prone 
In this talk I will give an introduction to variational inference methods and describe a general purpose inference engine called NAME Variational Inference for BayESian Networks which allows a wide variety of probabilistic models to be implemented and solved variationally without recourse to coding 
The talk will include a demo of NAME being used with a number of different models

Thanks for the argument adjunct domain stuff I ll try to rewrite my conditions 
What s the deadline for the workshop paper 
it might be better if I work out the noncoref conditions in NAME terms and we treat it as a joint paper but I m quite busy for the next couple of weeks 
The workshop deadline is tomorrow so I think that I ll submit what I ve got so far which suggests that the performance of the NAME and NAME algorithm is on average only NUM better when it s using the NAME and NAME parser than when it uses NAME GRs 
The performance is significantly better though 
There is a journal paper that I m thinking of writing special issue for the NAME conference 
It d be an extension of my NAME paper and this workshop paper varying full parsers in NAME and Leass and using a shallow parser in NAME and Leass basic comparison with NAME and NAME 
The deadline for that one is th March so that would make sense to be a joint paper if you did nt mind supplying me with the necessary linguistic knowledge to make some changes to my programs

Hi NAME 
Here are the baseline results for my classifier on the lingspam corpus 
precision for GENUINE NUM recall for GENUINE NUM 
precision for NAME NUM recall for NAME NUM 
F for GENUINE NUM F for NAME NUM 
There seems to be some confusion in the literature about the exact definitions of precision and recall for the class classification problem 
I define recall as NUM NAME FN and precision as NUM NAME FP 
where NAME true positive NAME false positive NAME false negative 
ie recall is measuring the number of correctly classified units for class CHAR against the number missed whereas precision is measuring the number of correctly classified units for class CHAR against the total number of class CHAR classifications made 
In some of the literature these measurements are the other way around 
This gives a precision recall F for each class

Hi NAME 
Thank you very much for the information about WordNet

physical entity

I ca nt save all words 
So I d like to have either the ability to 
program NAME with WordNet or to find another lexicon

in a discurse in order to model prosody 
I hope that my explanations are clear 
There are packages for the major scripting languages that allow you access to NAME I personally use the NAME package 
If you search for that in the web you ll find it

Dear NAME Many of you may by now have heard the shocking news that the University of NAME is intending to close its Linguistics Department 
NAME NAME has written to ask whether colleagues might feel able to write to the NAME NAME in protest 
My own feeling is that it would be right to do so but I would not wish to speak for the Association without asking members for your views 
If the general feeling is that the Committee should not write on behalf of the NAME I will be writing in any case in my own capacity as a Professor of Linguistics at another NAME University 
However my feeling is that a letter from one of the main learned societies in the academic discipline involved might be helpful to the case

On Mon NUM May NUM NAME NAME wrote 
I m not sure if such a corpus would be more use to spammers to overcome bogofilter see feature article in NAME Scientist about a month ago hide some genuine text into a spam email to tip the probabilities all wrong but anyway 
This is already standard practice though they simply type banal headers and do nt bother to model real text statistically 
The point of a statistical approach is that it can always renew adapt it s model of spam but needs a good idea of what a genuine email looks like too esp 
if the NUM get closer over time 
It depends very much on the subject 
For example I could send you the contents of my supervision folder which is full of emails related to supervision organisation 
But that might bias things a bit I mean you might conclude that genuine email is more likely to contain words like supervision than it actually is 
Bias from any NUM source is not likely to be a problem as we plan to gather a large corpus ideally k or so of emails 
NAME will get in touch about what you might donate thanks 
I m not NUM convinced that it s not copyright violation for me to use other people s emails without asking them 
I trust the anonymiser removes ALL numbers NAME and NAME NAME 
Try it and see for yourself copyright is in verbatim text and has to be asserted at the time of dissemination 
Nevertheless you are right that there is an issue of privacy so you shld not submit anything that you think your friends would object to once anonymised 
It might make things better if people can anonymise their mail BEFORE sending it to you rather than trust that you re not accidentally reading the original version 
If you 
The system relies on having preferably large coherent bodies of emails to do it well 
The site is to give you a taster of what your email shld look like when anonymised 
We ll only be looking at the anonymised email very selectively to check for errors so at that stage it shld be pretty harmless as we wo nt know whose it is etc 
It might be quicker just to look at lots of NAME threads or something like that I think at the moment any thread that is big is not likely to be spam although it s theoretically possible that spammers will reply to real threads 
This is certainly NUM source if manually filtered but probably not a very good model of the full range of genuine email

NAME 
You might be interested in some initial results the test set is NUM genuine emails and NUM spam 
For the genuine emails 
NUM NUM classified as NAME 
NUM NUM classified as GENUINE 
For the spam emails 
NUM NUM classified as NAME 
NUM NUM classified as GENUINE 
A reasonably good starting point I think plenty of room for improvement but relatively high success at classifying genuine email is encouraging as that is perhaps the most safetycritical aspect 
I have nt studied the spam results in detail yet but I suspect many of the misclassifications are due to the fact that I am only classifying the body text at the moment and many of the training spam emails only contain a subject and perhaps a weblink or something in the body 
Anyway I ll keep you posted

Re NAME Question
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Hello everybody 
I would like to ask you a question is it possible to convert a plain document written in the word processor word into a NAME one 
What do you mean with plain document 
You can write quite a lot of formats with word 
If plain means ASCIItext with linefeeds you can simply write a perl script like 
while chomp print line print print linen 
You can also load your document with NAME and save in NAME s native format it will be NAME then but the markup is probably not what you need

Re email

Hey NAME 
I guess you looked at the website right 
Making the corpus body of email data available to the academic community means just that 
The idea is that the anonymisation procedure removes any references to real people places organisations locations etc and then the corpus is used as a benchmark training and testing resource for academics doing research into the junk email classification problem 
That means that they will use computers to generate statistical probabilities of certain words appearing at certain places in emails and then use these to classify new emails as either genuine or junk 
Having a corpus that multiple people test systems on is vital for reproducibility of experiments etc 
Do nt worry noone as seen any of the emails you let me use 
Obviously I did nt use any of the NUM from NAME etc anyway The idea of the website is to convince people that it is safe to use the emails they donated as part of this corpus because it will be impossible to tell where the emails came from where they were sent to who they were about etc etc 
But this will only happen with explicit permission from the donor and if you re not happy about yours being used in that way then that s fine 
It s still been really useful for me to use them thus far 
Speak soon

Re NAME statistical named entity recognition

I am chairing a workshop NUM July NUM after NAME NUM NAME intended to address questions related to multilingual NE recognition and reusability of statistical and symbolic methods across languages 
I encourage you and and others to submit a paper to the workshop and or to attend it

Note NAME is providing some travel funds to help defray expenses for students 
NAME NAME NAME Natural Language Group Title and description Multilingual and Mixedlanguage Named NAME NAME NAME NAME and Symbolic Models 
Organizing Committee NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME 
Description Named Entity NE Recognition systems vary widely from highspeed bulk methods optimized for indexing to deep semantic parsers tuned for specific domains 
Optimal ways to combine statistical and symbolic models also vary depending on applications and tasks 
Is it possible to 
maximize use of knowledgerich resources eg lexicons NE grammars parsing while permitting corpusbased training for domain or language 
acquire and share resources including lexicons and grammars across languages 
balance performance speed with reasonable accuracy 
use specific language patterns while permitting rapid transfer to another language 
minimize variability in results across language types 
We welcome research on combined models in which these tradeoffs are calculated in particular ways 
We hope that the workshop will bring together work on robust and deep multilingual and mixed language NE recognition from different perspectives 
Possible topics include 
the role of the lexicon vs dynamic processing information 
grammars and lexicons shared or ported across languages acquisition of multilingual resources eg from corpora translating NEs across multiple languages 
domain tuning 
Papers may cover NUM or more of these or related areas 
Demonstrations of implemented NE systems are also welcome

Hello list members My Ph NAME thesis is to be on named entity recognition for Norwegian 
I want to use existing programming tools implementing different statistical methods 
Most of my reading has been on maximum entropy modelling 
Do any of you have any experience with existing tools that can be used for named entity recognition 
Ideally I would like to be able to experiment with the kind of information provided to the system so I want open source code that can be modified 
In the case of maximum entropy modelling I would appreciate the possibility of trying different algorithms 
It would be an extra bonus if I could try out the frequency redistibution algorithm advocated by NAME 
I intend to post a summary of the comments received

NAME Experiments on the Automatic Induction of German Verb Classes 
Speaker NAME NAME im NAME University of NAME 
NAME 
The verb is central to the structure and the meaning of a sentence so available lexical resources on verb knowledge represent an important means for Natural Language Processing applications 
This talk focuses on the automatic induction of verb classes a clustering methodology is developed which utilises the relationship between verb meaning components and verb behaviour to provide a classification of German verbs 
In the first part of the talk I describe the acquisition of lexical syntactic and semantic verb properties from an unsupervised trained statistical grammar model 
The properties are used to define German verbs on NUM levels of verb description purely syntactic frame types prepositional phrase information and selectional preferences 
In the second part of the talk I describe the adjustment of the standard clustering algorithm kMeans to the task of inducing semantic verb classes from the various verb descriptions 
The clustering parameters clustering evaluation and clustering results are interpreted and discussed

Then I ll send it to NAME if you like cced to you or someone in NAME 
After that you and NAME can take over wrt publication issue proofing production etc

Student access to the library
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
For the attention of the library committee 
There has been a request at the SSCOM for outofhours access to the library by students 
The initial request is believed to be from Diploma students but there is a feeling that this is likely to be the thin end of the wedge 
In order to guide the library committee in deciding the policy I have been asked by the NAME to write a note about the technical and administrative issues involved 
Access control to the NAME and major areas within it is controlled by electronic locks operated by cards 
There are NUM types of cards and associated reader 
The NAME cards read by proximity readers 
The University card read by NAME swipe readers 
At present students on taught courses other than the NAME are NOT issued with NAME cards they only have University cards 
Just NUM doors are fitted with NAME readers alongside the NAME readers student entrance NUM door to NAME and NUM door to the west terrace 
Therefore as things stand we cannot straightforwardly offer card access to the library for NAME and Diploma students 
Possible solutions if we wish to do so are 
NUM Extend the unlocked hours 
All of the electronic doors can be put on a time schedule which can be quite complex 
It is quite straightforward to extend the hours that the doors are unlocked giving access to anybody who can get into the building 
This could in principle be combined with paying somebody to supervise the library 
NUM Equip the NUM doors on the route to the library with NAME readers 
This will have a capital cost it needs more than just the reader and it may be difficult to conceal the new wiring in the existing 
walls neatly 
It will also take time to organise 
NUM NAME all students with NAME cards which would allow us finegrained control over the access each could have 
Although superficially attractive it is precisely what we wanted to avoid when we took the decision to install NAME support alongside NAME 
There would be some cost in supplying the physical cards but this is small in comparison with the administrative burden of issuing cards handling lost cards etc The Continuum system is such that the card handling procedures have not been as easy to automate as we had hoped and a significant amount of Computer Officer time is required to deal with them 
NUM As NUM but restrict the card issue to individuals who make a good case for it a sticky door policy 
This is predicated on the assumption that relatively few students are likely to wish to use the library out of hours in practice 
The danger is that many would apply just in case or in the mistaken belief that the card would give access to the rest of the building 
We could consider discouraging this by charging a deposit but it might be hard to justify this being more than the replacement value of the card under pound NUM a relatively trivial sum

Re this extraordinary stuff from the NAME NUM min breakdown no nonexamined lectures 
is anybody in the NAME resisting this sort of crap 
NAME may think they are promoting better higher education but what they are actually doing is destroying it 
or shd one just be cynical and tell lies or waffle on about the fact that any material in any lecture can be some sort of prerequisite background for some exam question in the sense that knowing it will support better motivated answers to the actual questions asked 
I am saddened by the fact that going through slides of some of NAME s talks it s clear that though they give the very solid framework what he actually said was what mattered and while he certainly had more detailed notes for undergraduate lecturing the idea that what he said as opposed to what the students were supplied in written form with was NAME ornament or reiteration is really lowering

really sounds like the dept is right behind me taking sabbatical 
Dear NAME 
I do not know what to say re your sabbatical 
I think you just have to plug ahead and do what you feel you need to do 
The decision about whether or not you get leave will not be mine 
My position is this My main concern as NAME has to be about having adequate resources in the area 
Obviously if NUM person or more 
there s not only you and NAME goes away their tasks have to be replaced and that will inevitably mean sharing out some of the burden among the rest of us 
I am concerned because some people are already working beyond reasonable capacity 
This is a real issue as NAME has a history of people being overworked and then off sick 
Even if we were to get a fractional appt which is what I will argue for that still leaves admin tasks to be shared out because temporary fractional appointments will not be expert admin people 
They wo nt be likely to be able to carry the kind of burden that more experienced colleagues can 
That makes it all the more difficult to alter the NAME role along the lines agreed by all of us 
And a fractiuonal appointment is likely to be for less than a semester year 
In your case I had hoped that you could have taken on rather more in your year tutor role as nd year tutor is one of the admin jobs that hitherto has not been hugely demanding 
I was hoping that we could institute a new better fairer system for teaching and admin that would give us all research time including sabbaticals on a rota rather than a competetive basis 
But getting such a system in place is a team effort and takes time 
It s going to be much harder to do that if people are away 
There is also the question of the NAME replacement applying for sabbatical leave is making a powerful statement about being out of the running for that 
I personally would rather the NAME issue were dealt with before sabbaticals were considered 
It s all very complicated and so I can only say that you should do what you feel you have to do 
There s an inevitable tension between personal interest and team interest but fortunately it will be up to the NAME committee to decide about research leave and not up to me 
Sorry NUM cannot be of more concrete help NAME

NAME I thought you were 
ORG I ve been trying to reach you on the phone this am but you are busy busy busy 
I thought you were meeting with NAME and NAME today to discuss amongst other things the sabbatical situation 
Or is this just in my head somehow the th has stuck in my brain as an imp 
date 
I really would like to discuss this situation with you 
If I want to be able to do this plan in NAME I will need to set wheels in motion the logistics are endless 
Incidentally I still have not heard back from NAME regarding my original email though I did write to her to that effect about NUM days ago message also not acknoweldged 
Though she and NAME both told me I should go for the round of readerships in the university in June by her not responding to my precise questions surrounding this I do wonder how much she really is behind me

Re Past Presidents Politics Fwd

<BODY>
To NAME NAME 
I wanted to express my support for what you ve written 
I could nt have expressed it better but your letter echoes my own reaction to the initial past presidents letter 
I m a bit confused by Ad NAME s letter disagreeing with you having apparently said that an academic boycott is hence something that should not be debated by institutions like the NAME 
On the contrary your letter states As members of an academic association in this country it is our right and our duty to engage in a debate on where and how to set the standards of academic practice and behaviour 
It is also the right and duty of the leadership of any academic institution to engage in this debate 
I take it then that you agree with Ad NAME who says I think we all have the intellectual responsibility to debate exactly these issues 
Thank you for furthering this debate and pointing out some subtleties involved in the issue in question

I do nt think NAME would publish your squib as it stands without reviewing it not my decision anyway 
If you want to go this route I suggest you submit it to the editor NAME NAME with a note saying I encouraged this 
Alternatively you cld stick with NAME and still review the book in about NAME words for us pointing to this squib for more extended discussion 
For what it is NAME I agree with most of the substantive content of your squib but have a few comments which might help NAME 
very good comments thanks 
The problem is that taking them into account which we d be fools not to will make the squib longer not shorter 
It s almost k words now by the time we revised along the lines you suggest it will be k words I m afraid 
What you suggest have a smaller piece in NAME as a pointer to the larger squib in NAME may still make perfect sense the only question is what ground should be covered in this k review do you see it essentially as a precis of the squib or do you think it should concentrate on other points such as the NUM you bought up

Web page WEBSITE 
MOTIVATION Vast quantities of valuable knowledge are embedded in unstructured textual formats 
NAME of text are currently available on the public Web in intranets and other private repositories and on our personal desktop machines 
In many cases the only way to access such documents is through blunt instruments such as keywordbased document retrieval 
In recent years there has been significant research and considerable commercial interest in technologies for automatically extracting and mining useful structured knowledge from unstructured text 
Current trends suggest a movement away from pure natural language processing approaches requiring the manual development of rules to a shallower less knowledge intensive techniques based on techniques from machine learning information retrieval and data mining 
Adaptive text extraction and mining is an enabling technology with a wide variety of applications 
On the Web automated knowledge capture from text would open the way for both better retrieval and advanced business applications eg BB BC applications mediated by knowledgeaware agents 
For knowledge management capturing the knowledge contained in a companys repositories would encourage knowledge to be shares and reused among employees improving efficiency and competitiveness 
Extracting information from texts is an important step in capturing knowledge eg for populating databases or ontologies supporting document NAME eg for the Semantic Web for learning ontologies etc 
THE WORKSHOP The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from different communities eg machine learning text mining natural language processing information extraction information retrieval ontology learning to discuss recent results and trends in mining texts for knowledge capture 
Members of other communities eg information integration and data mining could find the workshop very interesting as well 
Previous workshops on the use of machine learning for information extraction were held at ORG ECAI and IJCAI 
AREAS OF INTEREST Areas of interest for the workshop include but are not limited to 
machine learning and natural language 
learning to annotate documents 
ontology learning 
information retrieval and learning 
information integration from textual and multimedia resources 
relevant aspects of humancomputer interaction and semisupervised learning 
SUBMISSION DETAILS ATEM will accept NUM types of submissions long papers that describe completed research maximum NUM pages and short papers that describe ongoing work or challenging ideas maximum NUM pages

Could you give me your opinion about the feasability of holding some sort of conference or meeting in NAME on or around the relevant date NUM August NUM 
It might be an idea sound NAME out about this and to check the date I m working off Who s Who but mistakes are always possible at the same time ask him about whether there is any chance of getting NAME NAME to contribute a preface page this would make the whole thing enormously more attractive to publishers 
Is this OK 
I m also going to circulate the group about whether the book should be published prior to the date of a meeting

Fellows photographs

Dear Fellows We have a Fellows photograph album in the NAME 
In the past every new Fellow has been asked to submit a photograph for it 
The album has proved very useful for new Fellows in identifying old NUM and for old Fellows in identifying new NUM 
It also provides lots of amusement 
When a Fellow leaves the photograph goes into the archive for ever 
We are often asked by press and publishers for copies of such photographs and indeed they expect us always to have them 
Unfortunately in recent years Fellows have been very bad at responding to the request for a photo and I believe also that in the last year or NUM the responsibility for making the request has fallen between NUM stools 
As a result the photograph album is losing both its usefulness and its entertainment value 
I am also aware that a number of Fellows will be leaving shortly and we shall have no photographic record at all 
THIS MESSAGE IS A PLEA FOR A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU if you know we do nt have one already 
The convention used to be for a studio portrait one of the reasons we stopped getting them I suspect however we should be happy to accept anything however snappy

NAME Foundations of SpeechtoSpeech Translation 
NAME 
NUM 
NAME NUM 
NAME NUM pounds hardback 
xii pages 
NAME was a project for speechtospeech translation that lasted NUM years and encompassed NUM research groups primarily in NAME 
The original goal was to develop a portable translation system for German and English for the domains of appointment scheduling and travel planning 
Later translation between German and Japanese was added and both a telephone translation system and a remote maintenance system for NAME were developed 
This book contains NUM articles grouped into NUM sections which address various aspects of the NAME project 
The title is somewhat misleading as the phrase foundations of speechtospeech translation seems to imply that the book will be instructive with respect to the task or at least contain comprehensive highlevel discussion about it 
Instead most articles of the book report on specific components and approaches developed and utilized to support speechtospeech translation in NAME 
This is fine but readers should be aware that the book is in no way a textbook background knowledge relevant to the individual topics is assumed by the authors of most articles 
Having said this if the term foundations is taken to mean consideration of all the various kinds of data components techniques etc that could take part in performing the task then the articles of the book certainly cover the ground extensively 
The articles themselves vary in their focus and emphasis 
The stated goals of NAME were essentially oriented toward producing an end application and this course provided an excellent setting for a considerable amount of research to be done 
Thus some articles could be roughly characterized as here is how we made it work while others could be captioned as here is this interesting thing we did within the scope of the project 
As such there is material of interest for both academically and commercially oriented readers 
Throughout the book there is a strong emphasis on producing modules that can perform their computations in realtime and with such a large number of different technologies applied in NAME this should be of interest to those interested in developing various kinds of practical NAME systems 
With all the different topics covered much more high level discussion of how the various bits and modules fit together would have been very welcome including even brief overviews of the different sections explaining basically what the different articles are about and why they are there 
Such overviews also could have provided a forum for more metalevel discussion on how well the different approaches and strategies worked out 
It would also have been useful to have a map of the system with pointers to the articles where the relevant modules are discussed it is sometimes hard to tell what depended on what from just reading the articles and it is often necessary to crossreference several articles to properly situate them within the context of the overall system 
The articles are too numerous and diverse in specialization to comment on each one individually in a short review by NUM reviewer however I will try to give an overall sense of the book s contents in the remainder of this review 
The first section contains NUM articles that provide an overview of the completed NAME system and facts and figures about the project itself 
The overview is quite useful for getting a feeling for the system as a whole before launching into the articles on the specifics 
It provides very highlevel descriptions of some of the various components and how they fit together as well as general discussion regarding the scope of the task which was undertaken the data collection effort and software architecture 
It concludes by summarizing some of the lessons learned over the course of the project unfortunately only NUM pages are devoted to this when in fact it seems that it would be worthy of its own chapter 
Also the overview clearly stays focused on the successes of NAME whereas it would be very beneficial for the reader whether research or application oriented to also hear about the problems that were encountered and the things that did not go so well 
The next section contains NUM articles that deal with topics in processing spoken input with all its messy details and transforming it into representations that can be processed by the syntax semantics and translation components 
The first half of the section is concerned with the methodologies and techniques for speech recognition covering topics such as language identification providing robustness in the face of various noise conditions optimizations for improving the efficiency of speech recognition components and investigations into new techniques for capturing long range dependencies in language modeling 
The latter articles report on the creation of pronunciation dictionaries from data to provide variants for canonical pronunciations the NAME and classification of prosodic information detection of emotional behavior by users and the detection and correction of speech repairs as a filter process between recognition and subsequent processing stages 
The third section is the largest it includes NUM articles addressing lexical and syntactic processing 
NUM different approaches to parsing were developed and integrated a robust chunk parser built from a cascade of finite state transducers a probabilistic NAME parser and an optimized NAME NAME NAME Grammar NAME parser 
These approaches which are each discussed in separate articles provided the means to balance robustness with accuracy and depth of syntactic analysis 
There is also a further brief article describing how their results were combined 
While the NAME parser provides full semantic analyses the chunk parser and NAME parser produce only syntactic trees how interpretations are read from these trees is discussed in an article on semantic construction 
The use of a NAME syntactic framework such as NAME required considerable justification in the face of the cost of developing grammars and efficient parsing techniques the third section contains an article that lays out some of the arguments for using NAME over other available frameworks and answers some of the concerns regarding the efficiency and complexity of having deep analysis as such at all 
NUM further articles describe aspects of the NAME grammars which were developed for German English and Japanese 
Since the results of the NUM parsers need to be integrated into a single interpretation for further processing it was necessary to develop a standard interface representation that abstracted from the particularities of each of the approaches 
For this NAME NAME Terms NAME were developed and employed and are motivated and described in detail in the fourth article in this section 
NAME provide an underspecified flat representation that permits many different kinds of information about an utterance to be stored and accessed including basic predications scope constraints sorts discourse relations syntactic features tense and aspect and prosody 
The final article of this section describes the multilingual lexical databases that were developed and highlights some of the issues in dealing with the morphology of the different languages and ensuring that it was possible to retrieve translation equivalents from NUM language to the other for the semantic transfer translation component 
There are NUM articles on aspects of semantic processing in the fourth section 
The first discusses how the analyses produced by the NUM different parsers were combined to produce a single semantic output and the second deals with processing the intermediate NAME hypotheses of the parsers in robust manner that corrects certain recognition errors and disfluencies in the semantic output of each parser 
The next paper focuses on how some of the nonlocal ambiguities in NAME were resolved by incorporating discourse and prosodic information 
The rulebased module employed for this handled aspects such as verb and adverb disambiguation anaphora and ellipsis resolution and focus projection 
The final article in this section relates how the semantic databases were designed to support multiple languages and ensure that they map material in a given source language to comparable semantic relations in NAME to assist in semantic transfer translation 
In the fifth section we come to descriptions of the actual translation engines employed in NAME 
NUM main approaches were explored semantic transfer statistical translation substringbased translation casebased translation and dialogact based translation 
The different engines tackled the problem in significantly different ways that gave them in some cases complementary strengths and weaknesses 
Echoing the multiengine approach to parsing discussed earlier the translations ultimately produced by the NAME system were chosen from those created by these different modules based on the confidence values they assigned to their outputs 
The sixth section contains NUM articles which address the recognition representation and use of discourse information within the system 
The first article explicates the representation of dialog including illocutionary force propositional content and temporal expressions and the following article discusses how dialog structures are produced for the purposes of both contextsensitive translation and producing multilingual summaries of the dialogs mediated by NAME 
The final article describes the module which performs contextual disambiguation using the variety of sources of information built up during the deep processing path in NAME and which plays a role in semantic transfer translation 
The seventh section deals with sentence realization and speech synthesis 
First to be discussed is the NAME generation component which takes the NAME output by the semantic transfer translation module and determines how they should be expressed 
After a NAME is fully specified it is handed to NUM syntactic realization components one which uses NAME Grammar NAME and another which uses NAME 
The grammars for the former realizer are compiled from the English and Japanese NAME grammars discussed earlier the HPSGtoTAG compilation process is the subject of the second article in this section 
The next article deals with the creation of dialog minutes and summaries a useful task which crucially relies on the dialog processing component described in the previous section and the generation component covered in this one 
The final article discusses the concepttospeech synthesis component used for producing the final spoken output of the system 
The articles in the eighth section describe various aspects of the data collection and corpus creation efforts and evaluation and analysis of different components of NAME 
These include information about recording transcription treebanking and analysis of the data utilized to develop the NAME system 
NUM articles provide evaluations of the speech recognition and synthesis components and the quality of the different translation paths 
These evaluations were carried out at different sites from those which produced the modules which was certainly of particular importance for the translation evaluation which involved NUM competing approaches 
There is a further article on a module which attempts to select the best output from one of the translation modules based on the confidence values they produce this article might have been better situated in the fourth section of the book especially since it provides some higher level discussion of the different translation approaches 
Finally the NUM articles in the ninth section deal with concerns of software architecture and integration 
Since NAME involved NUM research groups with scientists and programmers with varying competencies with respect to programming skills and knowledge of software engineering it was no small task to coordinate the components that were produced at the individual sites and enable them to work together as a whole 
A special group was devoted to this task and the article on their effort provides an informative look at the technical and sociological issues which were overcome in this integration 
The other article describes how NAME was extended to provide telephone translation services 
NAME tackled all sorts of problems on all sorts of fronts resulting in an impressive and extensive body of work that led to NUM scientific publications and NUM spinoff products 
The project s funding and activities provided an immense boost for computational linguistics research and development in NAME 
This book provides significant insight into the project and it will be useful to researchers and commercial developers who are interested in specific aspects of speechtospeech translation and how they fit within the context of an overall system for translation 
The articles are so diverse that it is hard to imagine any single person reading all of the articles contained in the collection since only a subset of them are likely to be of particular interest to any given reader nonetheless it will certainly be an excellent resource for anyone who is specifically interested in NAME itself and can use it to quickly find information on all the modules in NUM big handy volume

here are the first NUM examples of P ps with the CHAR being a NUM in file NUM 
I think they are all wrongly parsed 
But perhaps the bad tokenization was interacting because I think it s not as frequent as it was in the other file I was looking at 
to do the semantics right for these I d need to distinguish the subordinating conjunction case from the normal preposition case they ideally need different types of tag entry because subordinating conjunctions are handletaking 
I can do this anyway since simplex prepositions are a closed class so it s not a problem it s just that I was looking at this NAME it seemed an interesting case but then discovered there seemed to be errors

of the NAME 
NUM NAME of NAME Notes The Teaching Committee has requested clarification on the issue of copyri ght 
of lecture notes 
The Council s opening statement at the Discussion on Intellectual Prope rty 
Rights contained the following 
NAME Council wish to put on the record that their intention is not to a ssert 
ownership of copyright in lecture notes or books except where explicitly 
agreed as part of a commissioning process for example as might occur for the 
creation of material for elearning 
The Head of Department interpreted this to mean that the authors of mater ial 
which is explicitly commissioned would have to agree to the commissioning and 
the transfer of copyright 
As far as he was aware no such commissioned 
material for teaching under the Syndicate s jurisdiction had been produ ced 
It was his belief that if the Syndicate felt that there was a case for 
material to be commissioned for example for an elearning course then he 
would consult the Department before proceeding 
He suggested that license to use rather than copyright transfer would then be a more appropriate approach 
Following further discussion Professor NAME reiterated that the position 
was clear copyright remained firmly in the hands of the author 
NUM Calculators for use in NAME The currently approved calculator had been discontinued and its replacement 
had features that were a cause of concern to the Board of Examinations

Aims Scope of GRAMMARS 
GRAMMARS is an international forum for the dissemination of highlevel original research in the intersection between mathematical computational linguistics and formal language theory 
The journal is based on the fact that a certain gap exists between linguiststrying to find adequate formal tools for natural language description and computer scientistsoften unconcerned with the descriptive applicability of the generative devices they design 
The aim of the journal is to bring both communities together and to provide a platform for discussion

Re NAME Statistical tests for corpus studies
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
NAME NAME wrote 
But there is a problem with the NAME test of too many NUM in the slices as your NAME paper points out NAME 
For example in the NAME and NAME comparison only words with a frequency of NUM or more in the joint corpus had few enough NUM for the test to be applicable 
This means that one of the word types in the joint corpus were omitted from the comparison 
But if there is nt enough data we should nt be drawing any inferences so that seems right 
A name or technical term that gets used lots of times but in only NUM or NUM documents is not good for basing any inferences on 
Some thought has to be given to slice size and how the corpus is to be sliced up which will interact with the number of NUM values you ll get for the test

The project will focus primarily on aspects of human language production addressing the issue of the conditions under which producing an utterance may draw upon off the shelf expressions that are prestored in long term memory rather than involving full grammatical encoding 
The project will explore the relationship between these NUM language production routes 
This question has general psycholinguistic relevance and is also important in the context of developing synthetic speech aids for people who are unable to speak 
The project will employ a wide range of different research methods such as reaction time and headmounted eyetracking experiments

Joint supervision will be provided by Professor NAME NAME Dr NAME NAME NAME and Dr NAME NAME 
Potential applicants are welcome to make informal contact with any of the supervisors

Hi 
Re your NAME question how to get the probability out of a NAME built using NAME 
There appears to be a CHAR function around though I have nt even seen it 
My estimates are that a class based NAME of around NUM mil words on a NAME NAME will take around half an hour to build and a tool called LAdapt can be used to adapt it

Re interpolation
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
OK the problem is this 
I ve already got log CHAR CHAR and log CHAR CHAR because I m calculating probabilities in log space to avoid underflow 
Thus I have to find the equivalent of interpolating in the normal probability space 
NAME is that normal interpolation requires addition which does nt have an equivalent in the log space 
Thus the only thing I can think of is to scale and convert back to normal probs but this still might cause problems with under overflow if the probabilities are markedly different 
Any further ideas I d be grateful 
Thanks NAME

Of course you ll have a language NAME problem if you do nt know the language you re searching for

Also we occasionally have found translations which are distributed as NAME files from which NUM cannot extract the text Persian Farsi is NUM example

Hi 
The workplan spec quotes resources of the order of MHz processor MByte NAME NUM NAME disc space MByte scratch disc 
I figured out I would go ahead with the C MERGERS ACQUISITIONS topic code but did nt know where to find the relevant files in the huge corpus as the files had WEBSITE these did contain some code info 
I am a bit lost about which zipped file CHAR would be relevant to my topiccode 
However NAME NAME NAME s report of last year I figured out that he stored each such zipped file in the local scratch and further worked with Each days unzipped NAME files 
So I guess a further NAME of scratch disk space would suffice ie total of abt NAME 
Please let me know if I am on the right lines 
Many Thanks NAME NAME

WEBSITE NAME NAME provides commercial licensing support and consultancy for the robust accurate statistical parsing NAME toolkit 
The toolkit allows rapid development of advanced text management applications such as text classification summarisation mining and querying 
It is uniquely capable of supporting the next generation of such systems which go beyond pure term indexing or domainspecific entity extraction 
The NAME toolkit is a package of text processing modules which annotate text with linguistic information concerning the entities referred to properties predicated of these relations and relations which hold between them 
For instance the following text sentencefrom the transcript of President NAME s speech at the NAME Museum Center on th October NUM is analysed into sets of entities and relations between them some of which are shown underneath Members of the NAME of both political parties and members of ORG ORG agree that NAME NAME is a threat to peace and must disarm 
Entities Members of the NAME of both political parties Members the NAME both political parties political parties parties NAME NAME NAME NAME ORG ORG ORG the ORG the Council Relations the NAME agrees NAME be is a threat the Council agrees NAME be is a threat the NAME agrees NAME must disarm the Council agrees NAME must disarm The actual output of the system further decomposes and classifies these relations and there are other output formats href Termbased systems represent text documents as bags of words ie sets of characters between white spaces but will not directly recover the entities referred to in a document such as NAME NAME political parties ORG ORG or members of NAME of both political parties 
Representing entities rather than terms supports more powerful and precise information management because it provides a better basis for cross indexing variants both within and across documents such as the NAME NAME Council or the ORG and thus also a better way of classifying summarising or querying document content via salient entities 
The NAME system recovers noun phrases referring to entities and classifies them in a domainindependent way into names subdivided into places people organisations numbers including ranges dates etc measure phrases ounce year etc temporal expressions days weeks months directions north south etc and so forth 
Relational representation of entities provides a natural and effective mechanism for crossindexing alternate descriptions of entities via subsets of relations href 
Extant systems for extracting entities from text based on deterministic finitestate pattern matching rely heavily on manuallysupplied domainspecific lexical information from the outset 
The relational information recovered by the NAME system can be used to index who did what to whom and supports precise querying about the properties predicated of specific entities across a document collection 
A relational pattern like the NAME NAME Council agree What does the NAME NAME Council agree can be matched intelligently against document annotations yielding precise specific and small amounts of focussed information 
This approach to information retrieval deals naturally with noncontiguous text sequences mapping to the same underlying entity or relation the ORG the NAME NAME Council as well as other well known problems with pure term or entity based systems such as negation the Council not agree NAME must disarm neq the Council agree NAME must disarm 
The NAME toolkit achieves about NUM accuracy recovering entities and relations from arbitrary English texts without making use of domainspecific lexical information 
It has been used to date to analyse about NUM million words of English 
A recent paper from a refereed conference proceedings gives more details about each module of the toolkit and compares performance to related systems 
NAME and performance for specific applications can be considerably improved by semiautomatic customisation on domain and or application specific text 
The toolkit is fully compatible with existing NAME standards for text NAME up and can be used to leverage web sites which will conform with emerging standards for the semantic web NAME NAME href 
A nonexclusive commercial licence to use the NAME toolkit which includes NUM hours support and consultancy to assist with customising and integrating the toolkit into the client s application costs pounds NUM NUM 
The toolkit is available free for noncommercial use including prototyping and proofofconcept work in industry 
Support for this and or general consultancy on NAME IR applications and systems is available from NAME Ltd at a rate of pounds NUM hour 
The cofounders of NAME are NAME NAME and NAME NAME 
The NAME toolkit is the product of collaborative research at the University of NAME NAME Laboratory and University of NAME ORG 
NAME NAME has sole rights to commercial exploitation of the toolkit and works closely with these academic groups to continuously enhance and improve the performance of the toolkit

Dear NAME 
Please find below this week s issue of NAME written exclusively by NAME Group Analysts 
DISCOVERING A STRATEGY 
Discovery whether of information by an individual or of services by an organisation is essential for the effective use of the NAME 
The Web is an increasingly tangled morass of data the vast majority of which is not relevant to specific searches nevertheless search engines are regularly deceived into delivering hits that will waste the time of any searcher 
This is annoying for an enduser but potentially very expensive for a business which will lose productive employee time to sifting through search results 
Ensuring the filtering of information in a dependable manner is therefore a real business opportunity at both the individual and corporate levels and at present the dominant force in this space is NAME 
THE BIG NAME NAME has rapidly risen as a force to be reckoned with in the search field due to the strength of its algorithms and rapid brand creation but it is now also positioning itself as a potential rival to the established portal businesses such as NAME NAME and NAME s NAME NAME 
These sites have made considerable use of NAME s leading search technology which is increasingly placing them in potentially awkward positions 
On the NUM hand NAME searches are regularly driving new visitors to their sites and indeed NAME 
has been utilising NAME search technology since NUM 
On the other NAME is adding functionality and features such as news and shopping capabilities that undermine some of the core businesses involved in these sites and its influence is constantly growing 
As part of its response to this threat NAME 
has recently acquired NAME a search company based on technology that failed to compete with NAME 
No announcement has yet been made that NAME will replace the use of NAME at NAME but this is clearly only a matter of timing 
On the face of things this seems an uncertain strategy as the NAME search technology is perceived as being inferior to that of NAME 
However NAME 
has clearly recognised that in order to protect its longterm interests it must avoid any dependence on thirdparty search technology particularly when this is provided by an increasingly competitive business 
Much of the real value in the longterm discovery market will be in the feebased provision of serviceoriented searches in the Web services arena which will attract corporate business 
Emerging standards including the Universal Discovery Description and NAME NAME and the recently announced WSPolicy will combine to simplify the process of providing and acquiring business services online 
However these initiatives will not initially serve the needs of many smaller companies which will lack the developmental resources required to utilise them this leaves a vast discovery market that the leading brand portals will be able to enter as providers of service 
NAME GROUP OPINION The search industry has consolidated very rapidly in recent years and NAME is the clear winner at the individual user level 
If the portals are to succeed in preventing their core businesses from being leeched away by the expansion of NAME into new territories they must begin to make more decisive moves to position themselves as credible service providers in the discovery space if this is to be done successfully it will require investments in both technology and brand creation 
The portals must position themselves as discovery service providers now which will require investments in search technology such as that made by NAME or they may find that NAME will dominate that market as well 
MAKING DATA QUALITY COUNT 
It does nt matter how efficiently a company s NAME or NAME solutions are able to group and segment customers and their data to support the latest marketing campaign or promotional mail shot 
If the source data itself is of a poor quality then the information extracted may already have been compromised 
When you also consider the high levels of project failure reported within customer facing IT sectors it should be seen as a fundamental issue to ensure that data quality and accuracy is made a prime consideration 
THE BIG NAME Many enterprise level organisations keep commercial information about their customers and the products and services that they provide across a number of data stores 
Sometimes this may cause an inability to correctly identify customers or alternatively to identify the same customers more than once 
All of which can cause important customers to receive incorrectly addressed duplicate or inappropriate information 
The results being possible lost sales opportunities money wasted on capturing and maintaining useless or duplicate records and probably most importantly from a corporate perspective presenting an image to the outside world of inefficiency 
There are also other issues to be considered perhaps fraud prevention may be an important area especially to those delivering services in the financial sectors or the prevention of money laundering could be a key issue 
In each case the quality of the source data is important and lack of data quality can lead to undesirable activities being hidden 
Holding and maintaining records on a database whether customer product or other record types has a measurable cost both in terms of storage maintenance and support activities 
Therefore the value that can be derived from deploying a good quality data cleansing tool can be measured in a number of ways including reduced staff costs in the customer support and systems maintenance areas reduced mailing costs by ensuring that offers made are correctly targeted and individual customer duplications are removed and increased sales revenue through having the ability to accurately identify crossselling and upselling opportunities 
NAME GROUP NAME Very few vendors working in the mainstream NAME NAME and NAME arenas would argue against the fact that data quality or lack thereof is one of the main issues when attempting to deliver effective business solutions 
Our view would be that there are at least NUM major areas of concern to be considered when looking at improving data quality within an organisation 
Firstly there is the initial issue of data cleansing which often in the past has focused on oneshot attempts to clean up customer and associated data with a specific goal in mind 
Secondly and an issue for any organisation that is serious about the quality of data that it continues to maintain there is the question of how to permanently maintain data integrity once the initial cleansing exercise has been completed 
When selecting a solution to imbed or run alongside mainstream infrastructure systems we would recommend that the selected system should be capable of providing both batch and realtime cleansing facilities especially in environments where data change is dynamic and especially where customer contact is made on the basis of the organisations in depth knowledge of the customer 
SPENDING BEFORE INFORMATION 
Despite figures that show that only NUM in NUM members of the public are accessing Government Web sites etail Web sites would appear to be faring rather better 
As is usually the case the trend has been set in the US with customer sales reaching just under US NUM billion in NUM but it appears that the NAME is now following NAME and is in serious catch up mode with online shopping growing NUM times faster in the NAME than in the US at present 
Although consumers still have concerns over the security of etail sites there are advantages to shopping online and it would appear that these advantages are at last making a breakthrough 
THE BIG NAME The Government has recently vowed to dedicate more funds to increasing the number of people who access its services online 
However it appears that etailers hardly have to try 
The interactive ORG NAME has found that NUM million NAME shoppers bought online in November NUM spending NUM billion pounds 
This figure is expected to rise to more than NUM in the next few months according to a NAME poll carried out on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry NAME 
The NUM billion pound figure for November is the biggest ever amount spent online in the NAME and represents a NUM rise on October s figures and a spectacular NUM rise on the same period for the previous year 
The benefits of buying online include time and monetary savings home delivery of goods and better consumer rights 
These benefits have however always been available and do not explain the huge rise in etail sales 
NAME has been improved which may have helped to allay some people s concerns although a survey carried out by NAME NAME found that around NUM of its respondents still felt uncomfortable giving out their credit card information online and similar percentages were worried about the security of online financial transactions and online privacy in general 
The rise in broadband takeup is also thought to be partly responsible for the rise in etail sales with its ability to make browsing and accessing etail sites even faster 
etailers in the NAME have been found to be better at converting browsers into customers 
NielsenNet Ratings found that of the NUM large developed economies they surveyed the NAME converted the most browsers into paying customers 
Other research by NAME also revealed that more people would be prepared to shop online if there were better guarantees about issues such as security and the quality of merchandise 
The NAME Government is helping to promote online buying by for example publishing examples of people who have benefited by making purchases online and generally promoting the online message 
NAME GROUP NAME Ease of use issues are important where both Government and etail Web sites are concerned but at the end of the day shopping ie spending money on things you want or need especially from the comfort of your own home is far more attractive than finding out information mostly concerning the payment of bills or mundane issues such as rubbish collection 
It may also be a case of preference and tradition 
People often wish to hear a real person tell them local government type information or to deal with a complaint but are quite happy to shop alone 
NAME etail sites are adept at attracting browsers and enticing them to part with their cash and can be secure in the knowledge that improvements to security will result in increased numbers of online consumers 
OUTLOOK WINTRY FOR NAME S IT STAFF 
NUM saw IT jobs continuing to be axed by employers in the NAME 
Reductions in endusers IT spending reined in the requirement for development and integration expertise from consultancies as well as causing the loss of jobs amongst inhouse IT staff 
IT budgets are likely to be severely limited in NUM with forecast growth as low as NUM 
THE BIG NAME Looking back only a few years many factors combined to produce a boom in NAME IT employment that will almost certainly never be repeated 
The recession of the early s left businesses and the public sector with a backlog of change requirements and facing a looming deadline to do something to address the NAME issue 
These circumstances saw many embark on the wholesale replacement of enterprise systems by customised redevelopment or more commonly by the procurement of package solutions both of which were readily supplied by a hungry and helpful IT industry 
NAME of utilities and the rapid growth of the mobile telecommunications industry were also significant drivers of IT spending 
After the millennium and the loss of confidence in dotanything there has seemed an uncertainty about how to deploy IT budget to best advantage 
The Government s determined spending is a sole exception perhaps unfettered by such considerations 
Organisations current IT spending plans reveal the priorities for the near future to be asset protection and consolidation 
Such investment as there is will be aimed towards security NAME to derive value from existing data content management with the same objective or application integration to enhance value from legacy systems and other existing software 
Like an increasing proportion of business requirements these will be addressed with maximum use of packaged solutions in order to hasten implementation and Return On NAME NAME 
NAME has proved attractive to many companies enabling them to reduce staff numbers and stabilise or reduce spending on IT 
The service provider to whom inhouse IT staff have been transferred use the human resources flexibly according to which of its customers need bodies from the pool of expertise achieving more efficient and dynamic deployment of staff 
Overall the number of IT resources required is reduced 
Indeed the outsourcing providers themselves increasingly consolidate and merge gaining further efficiency via reduction in numbers of consultants 
NAME GROUP NAME Advice for those hoping to thrive or perhaps even survive at a time of so much aggregation must be to work with a significant market player 
Skills in greatest demand change constantly but nevertheless must be kept up to date understanding what is shaping the employment market place is the best guide to what skills will be needed NAME Group s analysis is an invaluable aid 
Ominously for some offshore service providers have already provided costefficient expert resource and are likely to build on their success by competing more directly in the NAME market 
NAME Group has built a considerable reputation not only for the quality of its technical research but also for the ability to relate complex technical issues to the needs of business

Hi NAME 
Your email would be very gratefully received 
I m more concerned with genuine email as I already have a LARGE amount of junk extracted from an online archive 
The easiest way to donate email is to simply send the backend message folder files which include all of the header info 
For example if you have a folder entitled msgs then it will appear as the file msgs in the mail folder wherever your email is stored ie in your hermes filespace which can be accessed via ftp or similar 
These files can be fed directly into the anonymiser

I currently use NAME which since tweaked seems to do a fairly good job of filtering my mail but I can always filter it out to you rather than marking it as NAME and putting it in the trash 
Let me know how you want the mail whether you want mail forwarded copied in its raw state including all headers or whatever 
I do nt know whether you just want my NAME account which is mainly NAME stuff NAME or my general account email too which includes stuff from outside uni various hightraffic mailing lists occassional random email from someone who used my software which I wrote before coming to uni or a complaint from someone who s been infected by a virus and thinks I gave it to them etc I rarely get any viruses since NAME seems to stop prolific viruses in NAME and my external account is scanned in NAME although I do get the empty messages without the worms hey my NAME folder is full of emails from EMAIL at the moment

NAME NAME Studentships at NAME

UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX 
DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATICS 
NAME NAME Available 
NUM year PhD studentship are available starting on or around NUM October NUM associated with the following NUM NAME EPSRCfunded projects 
COGENT Controlled Generation of NAME 
Natural Language Generation NAME technology has reached a level of maturity where applied systems exist in a range of specialised realworld domains such as weather bulletins software documentation health and legal advice and stock market movements 
However developing such systems currently involves handcrafting and specialpurpose tuning by NAME experts which is nonportable nonscaleable timeconsuming and expensive 
Wider deployment of language generation requires more generally applicable and reusable NAME components based on widecoverage grammars however at present effective techniques for such widecoverage generation are not well understood 
The COGENT project will investigate systematically the characteristics of widecoverage generation and to develop techniques for controlling it effectively 
As well as furthering our understanding of widecoverage generation the project aims to deliver a substantial and novel resource to support future research in this area and practical implementations of widecoverage controllable generators 
The project is in collaboration with NAME University of NAME 
Natural Language Service Composition 
The pervasive computing environment of the future will provide a wide variety of services within the network 
The value of such services will be greatly enhanced if we are able to tailor our computing environment by composing services 
For example you might want to arrange for your heating to be turned off when your calendar indicates that you will be out of your house for more than a day 
This project investigates how NAME techniques can help make service composition a possibility for nontechnical users 
Services such as heating systems and personal calendars advertise themselves to a service directory that will develop an ontology of services 
This can be exploited to constrain the discourse domain in which users describe new features 
The interface will guide the user to an unambiguous expression of the new feature that can be mapped onto a standard component architecture of services 
These studentships would be suitable for people interested in carrying out research into areas such as 
statistical NAME 
applied natural language semantics 
lexical acquisition for practical language processing systems or 
the association of linguistic knowledge with ontologies 
Applicants for these studentships should have a good first degree and or postgraduate qualification in computer science computer processing of language or similar 
The studentships covers tuition fees for NAME nationals the projects also pay a taxfree stipend starting at NAME NUM a year 
The grants include funds for attendance at relevant workshops and conferences 
See WEBSITE language processing work at the University of NAME

Re emails
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
At the moment I am taking nonspam emails on a personaluse only basis 
If I get to the point where distributing the corpus for wider use is a viable option I will need to go back to the people I got the emails from and get specific permission 
My current quite underdeveloped thoughts on anonymising are as follows 
replace person names in body text and subject field with some form of Proper Name tag 
remove email addresses from body text and subject field perhaps replaced with an Email Add tag containing the domain if nonsensitive 
remove postal addresses from body text and subject field again may be replaced with a Postal Address tag 
probably ignore From and To field information although could retain nonsensitive domain data 
It is likely that any classificationbased spam filter would be used in conjunction with a black white list technique so From and To information would be incorporated into that rather than the text classification side

what is your policy procedure for anonymising nonspam emails

Re rasp subcat lexicon
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
There are NUM verbs in NAME so it wld be interesting to know how well these map to the frequency ranking from NAME maybe we shld use Comlex as our list of verbs to build entries for 
Yes that would also enable me to use consistent method for lexicon building filtering 
We may want to omit some of the low frequency Comlex verbs though I made some calculations 
There re now NUM new files in usr groups dict subcat rasplexicon 
NUM incomlex 
which contains NAME frequencies for the NUM Comlex verbs NUM verbs occur more than NUM times NUM verbs occur less than NUM times 
NUM notcomlex 
which contains frequencies for the NUM NUM nonComlex verbs in NAME NUM verbs occur more than NUM times most are NAME spellings or noise from the tagger parser NUM NUM verbs occur less than NUM times 
There are another NUM which occur btwn NUM times and NUM which occur NUM times how do we know that NUM is the correct cutoff 
Maybe we shld be thinking more in terms of NUM egs verb so that we can allow for parse failures etc 
Yes I meant NUM occurrences after parsing ie after failures 
The above freqs were calculated from parsed data 
To end up with NUM we d need some NUM egs verb as input to parsing 
That s really the minimum 
The accuracy of both subcat acquisition and clustering drops sharply if we use less than NUM parsed sentences not sure about wsd sel 
prefs but I d imagine it s the same 
Generally of course the more data the better 
In my recent experiments I got best subcat and clustering results with my biggest dataset NUM egs per verb 
For the really frequent verbs should we use all the data we have in NAME or do we set some upper bound 
Perhaps this would be a sensible way to proceed 
Use some correlation of the NAME ranking and comlex to choose k verbs that we shld do ie add noncomlex verbs that occur more than NUM times in NAME 
Get all the relevant sentences from the NAME and re parse them and extract patternsets 
Get more sentences for those verbs underrepresented in NAME NUM egs by creating queries to NAME designed to find pdf ps documents containing them feed these sentences through pdftotext pstoascii some special preprocessing and then rasp 
I think I can set up the pipeline to parse and extract patternsets but it wld be good to check manually with NAME that we ll find enough relevant sentences this way for a small sample of underrepresented candidates 
Proceed as before 
Any thoughts 
This sounds good 
I can do the manual checking for NUM frequency ranges of samples of underrepresented verbs eg by next week

Re Review EVOLANG NUM
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
It is my understanding that the second review by an impartial reviewer was also negative 
At NUM NUM NAME NUM NUM NUM NUM NAME NAME wrote 
Dear NAME 
Here enclosed the mail we sent to NAME NAME editor of the volume of papers arising from the recent NAME Conference NUM to protest against an incorrect editorial choice since she chose as a reviewer the very proponent of the theory we critically examined in our submitted contribution 
Our intention is to let the community know this dysfunctioning since it will become impossible to establish a debate if the criticized theorist can stop it as reviewer 
Sincerely yours NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME Christian NAME 
NAME As you know the article that we have submitted for the Language Evolution volume belongs to a set of articles that refute point by point NAME NAME s theory that Neanderthal man did not have the anatomical prerequisites for producing the full range of human speech 
We received the NUM reviews of our paper and we told you that we felt it absolutely shocking that NUM of them had been done by PhD s 
We proposed in consequence that at least a third reviewer should be solicited 
Your answer was negative indicating I know from personal experience that one can often feel extremely angry when receiving rather negative reports Of course we are perfectly aware that it is not pleasant to have a submitted paper discarded but that is not the question each of us has already published a large number of papers in his life and knows what a review process is 
In your answer you add NAME I submitted a paper to Lingua which argued against the work on language evolution by XXX 
When the reports arrived it was clear that he was NUM of the referees This is by no means an isolated experience for me in my experience both with the NAME NAME of which I am an editor and in my own research it is 
normal for NUM of the reviewers to be the person whose work is called into question 
We do not think that this procedure is normal particularly if there are only NUM reviewers and there is a serious problem with the present review process 
Indeed the main opponent has been chosen as reviewer which is definitely not correct the more so since he used a number of arguments that clearly escape the scientific debate eg fraud accusation which is absolutely unacceptable and that we will certainly not accept and let propagate as such and a curious citation about NAME NAME and NAME NAME which has obviously nothing to do in a review process 
Hence we are in a situation in which since the beginning it is obvious that NUM reviewer over NUM will fight against this paper by any means even arguable NUM and certainly refuse it 
This is definitely unacceptable 
We feel that you and Ph NAME are unable to take the measure of a controversy which is fair and needs to be editorially processed with a debate 
We will let the community and first the Programme Committee of NAME NUM and the editors of Journals in the field of Phonetics and NAME NAME know about this review process and make their own judgment 
We hope that it will help improve further debates happen in a sounder way in the future 
Sincerely yours NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME Christian NAME 
NAME Surprisingly the NUM reviewers of our abstract to the NAME conference were quite positive about our work as you can see 
FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE on the EVOLUTION of LANGUAGE NAME March NUM NUM 
Dear Colleague 
Thank you for submitting an abstract to this conference 
I am pleased to tell you that the abstract submitted under the firstauthor name below has been accepted as the basis for a talk for the conference 
boe 
Meanwhile I include beneath the dashed line our referees comments on your abstract 
Best wishes NAME NAME 
Title of Paper The size of the pharynx An irrelevant parameter for speech emergence and acquisition 
Since NAME NAME postulated in NUM the theory that NAME were a speechless species the potential speech capability of NAME has been a debated question 
These authors claimed that the development of a low laryngeal position was a necessary condition for the realization of a sufficient number of vocalic contrasts since the potential vowel space was enlarged due to an enlarged pharyngeal cavity 
Like newborn infants NAME did not possess this anatomical basis of speech and therefore could not speak 
In this study we refute the NAME arguments developed by NAME NAME 
We quantify the vocal tract geometry by a NAME NAME Index corresponding to the length ratio of the pharyngeal cavity to the oral cavity 
Using a new anthropomorphic articulatory model controlled by lips jaw and tongue parameters we introduce variations of the NAME to approximate a vocal tract of a newborn infant a child a female adult and a male adult 
We generate the potential maximum acoustic vowel space with NUM NUM vowel items corresponding to these NAME NAME Index variations and we compare the results in the acoustic spaces of the first NUM formants with well known data of phonemes of the world s languages 
Our simulations show that the Maximal Vowel Space of a given vocal tract does not depend on the NAME NAME Index gestures of the tongue body lips and jaw allow compensation for differences in the ratio between the dimensions of the oral cavity and pharynx 
We infer that the vowel space of NAME with high or low larynx was no smaller than that of a modern human and that they could produce all the vowels of the world s languages 
Our study is strictly limited to the morphological and acoustic aspects of the vocal tract and we cannot therefore offer any definitive answer to the question of whether NAME spoke or not 
However we do feel safe in claiming that NAME were not morphologically handicapped for speech 
A low larynx and large pharynx cannot be considered to be the anatomical prerequisites for producing the full range of human speech 
If NAME could not talk it is unlikely to have been for the articulatory acoustic reasons advocated by NAME NAME 
NAME were no more vocally handicapped than children at birth are 
The brain is entirely capable of controlling a vocal instrument with a somewhat longer or shorter pharynx these differences do not actually change the capacity for maximally contrasting vowels 
There is therefore no reason to believe that the lowering of the larynx and a concomitant increase in pharynx size are necessary evolutionary preadaptations for speech 
Referee NUM 
Definitely accept 
Convincing attempt to deal with a previously proposed aspect of the theory of speech evolution by deducing corollaries from emprical NAME analysis 
Referee NUM 
Definitely accept 
This paper is among the first to challenge the well known hypothesis of NAME and his colleagues concerning the role of the lowered larynx in expanding the potential vowel space of NAME sapiens a hypothesis that has largely gone unchallenged despite sceptical murmurs from the wings for nearly NUM years 
The argument of the paper may not be without its difficulties in so far as it rests on a model of vowel production by a modern vocal tract 
Moreover if NAME s hypothesis is indeed false we are left without a plausible account of why the larynx lowered and as NAME observed increased the probability of death by choking 
Nonetheless the author s thesis is clearly argued and will doubtless stimulate much valuable discussion at the conference

Restrictions on incoming NAME to machines in the Lab NAME and NAME
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Executive Summary NAME access to nearly all NAME machines in the Lab will soon cease to permit ssh NAME and password based 
This only effects people logging into NAME Lab machines from outside the Lab 
If you cannot connect please try connecting to WEBSITE and seek help from EMAIL 
NAME NAME NAME 
Currently most machines in the Lab allow access using ssh protocols NAME and NAME using password or publickey based authentication 
V and password access are security concerns protocol problems and keyboard sniffers respectively so WEBSITE and WEBSITE already has the restrictions 
sshrelay will not allow ssh NAME connections but will allow password based authentication 
As such if you try to login and there is a problem try sshrelay NUM to check whether it is related to the changes 
You should be able to use the ssh or slogin command to connect from the relay machines to your desired machine 
Feel free to use the relay machines as a transition aid but note that they will not allow such access indefinitely so ensure that your ssh client can use publickey based NAME access 
If your remote ssh client had been using ssh NAME to connect to Lab machines in the past the machine may only have the ssh NAME public key of the Lab machine so when using ssh V it may complain that the key is unknown 
If so look for the host s fingerprint on the web page WEBSITE sshrelay is NUM NUM NAME ad NAME NUM NAME c NAME df fd NUM NAME NAME NUM NUM a 
Better still would be to jot down the fingerprint in advance 
With the fingerprint try connecting to the host again directly and when asked whether to continue check the fingerprint and continue if it is correct 
Otherwise contact sysadmin 
If your client does nt support ssh NAME or publickey try upgrading to a later version 
NAME users can use NAME and NAME users can use PuTTY 
Other packages which are layered on ssh scp cvs rsync pscp NAME etc will be similarly effected 
If you do nt have a public key you will need to generate NUM and arrange that the private part is available on the client outside the Lab machine and that the public part is registered in ssh authorizedkeys in your Lab filespace 
See WEBSITE key register it for incoming calls and converting it to a suitable form for the Windows ssh agent pageant 
Use a good pass phrase to encrypt the key and do NOT use any existing password 
Anyone setting things up in advance can test that things are working by WEBSITE which already has the restrictions in force

Dear NAME Many of you may by now have heard the shocking news that the University of NAME is intending to close its Linguistics Department 
NAME NAME has written to ask whether colleagues might feel able to write to the NAME NAME in protest 
My own feeling is that it would be right to do so but I would not wish to speak for the Association without asking members for your views 
If the general feeling is that the Committee should not write on behalf of the NAME I will be writing in any case in my own capacity as a Professor of Linguistics at another NAME University 
However my feeling is that a letter from one of the main learned societies in the academic discipline involved might be helpful to the case 
Views please 
I will be away from NAME from lunchtime on Sunday until Thursday morning and not accessing email but on my return I will post a summary if colleagues have contacted me off list

Re how to talk about a distinction in text mining

NAME 
As far as can remember dereferencing is the linguistic term for linking pronouns CHAR YOU and other references NAME THAT to persons and objects and subsequently loaned by IT for variables Implicit vs explicit then seems a natural way to make the distinction you re after 
Quite a mouthful though SMILEY 
NAME The border between the NUM depends on the NAME NAME at the low end only equation type dereferencing NAME NAME lives in NAME NAME at the high end also sophisticated dereferencing of pronouns over sentence boundaries

Re NAME Is the NAME a waste of time
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Whilst trying to observe and not react for a while so as to cut my email writing time NUM cannot but reply to this string with an unequivocal no NAME is definitely not a waste of time but a cornerstone of corpus linguistics 
It is obvious that for the small corpus designer NUM million or less tokens markup is a considerable investment in time 
However if one holds as I do that a corpus is not a simple mass of data but a carefully compiled selection of texts then we need a means to treat them as texts to store both their general features and their particularities 
This the NAME does 
In my own work in the field of English for Academic Purposes I tend not to use the corpus header but a standard individual header so as to stock all the bibliographic information and socilinguistic parameters associated with the text 
The depth of markup depends on my needs and time for an individual text 
In this way I can move with ease from a fully annotated single text to a more lightly marked up corpus 
This is possible because of the encoding possibilities of the NAME 
Education is very much part of the answer 
Easy access to vast amounts of downloadable data has meant that a number of corpus NAME neither know nor care about the niceties of corpus creation and the whys and wherefores of selecting and marking up data 
Ease of access has become the main criterion potentially to the detriment of the discipline itself 
Easy solutions do not necessarily answer the most pertinent questions 
It is true that all this takes time but if we throw out all that is timeconsuming drudgery from corpus linguistics we may find that we have thrown out our text baby with the corpus bathwater and are only left with readymade corpora for readymade answers 
Back to some time consuming markup

Dear NAME 
Yes I have some sympathy with the point you make 
The thing that has attracted me to the NAME in the past though is once the effort is made to get to grips with it and it is daunting there is usually a well thought through solution contained in it for almost any problem situation you come across in encoding a corpus 
With that said it is a clear theme of the posts so far that there is at the very least an advocacy issue related to the NAME in corpus linguistics which is interesting 
Best 
CHAR 
Interesting question 
There are NUM issues here 
NUM Ignorance and confusion 
Most people have only a vague idea what NAME is or does or what it is good for 
There would need to be a effort to re educate the potential users of NAME 
Does NAME do something different from NAME 
Absurd question I know but that is the kind of confusion which I suspect exists 
NUM Complexity 
When it was introduced many people reacted against it as too complex 
Now they have all adopted xml rdf etc which are much more complicated to use 
So potential users perception would now be ripe for a representation of NAME 
Related to both of these issues is that of the documentation available to educate people help potential users understand what NAME is does is good for 
A research assistant I have recently been poring over a 
couple chapters of the NAME guidelines looking for guidelines relevant examples to add some markup to our already mostly TEIconformant corpus markup scheme 
Although the documentation is extensive it is inadequate 
in many ways missing examples not very good at giving a larger picture to people who are nt sure if they need want the NAME at all or who just need some pointers to a few relevant sections 
If the only people who can read the documentation and make use of it are information library science people who are specifically trained in that area then it s no wonder NAME others who are in the business of building corpora are not using it or promoting it

Dear all 
NAME University is holding a NUM day workshop to discuss the recent advances and future direction for research in computational models of human sentence processing 
Those working in the field who are interested in attending the workshop should contact NAME NAME for further details EMAIL and confirmation as space is strictly limited 
NAME Computational models of sentence processing 
Dates NUM July NUM NAME NAME NUM minus NUM NAME NAME University NAME NAME 
Further details are available from the workshop website WEBSITE 
The workshop is organized by ORG the Department of Computationa CHAR Linguistics and Phonetics and the ORG NAME NAME and is part of the NAME NUM Resource Adaptive Cognitive Systems 
Workshop themes 
The workshop is intended to address what we view as NUM central issues for the development of computational models of human language processing 
We feel these issues represent the current stumbling blocks to constructing the next generation of models and our aim is to hear concrete views on how to tackle these problems now and where research efforts should be directed in the medium term 
NUM Models of working memory in language processing to what extent does human working memory influence language processing behaviour are the mechanisms for language processing adapted to take memory constraints into account 
More generally how should theories of sentence processing be situated within and reconciled with more general accounts of cognitive processing and cognitive limitations 
NUM 
Broad coverage how can we develop psycholinguistic models that scale up in such a way that explains both high performance in general as well as the more pathological behaviours focused upon in psycholinguistic research 
What kinds of mechanisms statistical constraintbased and linguistic theories dependency generative incremental seem most promising for developing broad coverage models 
NUM 
Semantics in performance how can we extend current syntacticallybased accounts with implementable approximations of human semantic knowledge lexical sentential as well as plausibility

NUM am 
ABSTRACT NAME is understood in the relationship between the sequence structure and solubility of a protein 
However it is clear that the function of a protein is intimately related to its solubility namely that structural proteins are insoluble while enzymes must have a very high solubility 
Our inability to predict solubility presents practical difficulties especially for NAME NAME Initiatives as up to NUM of nonmembrane proteins cannot be crystallised due to insolubility of the sample 
Furthermore it seems plausible that the mechanisms responsible for the formation of insoluble amyloid fibrils are similar to those at play in the formation of the random insoluble aggregates that form in inclusion bodies 
It is clear that the hydrophobic or polar content of the surface of a protein plays a key role in its solubility 
Given the collective behaviour of water we hypothesise that individual surface residues may not necessarily play a decisive role in dictating its solubility but that patches of residues may well do so 
To examine this we construct a score based on the average hydrophobic polar content of surface patches of atoms or residues over a set of NUM monomeric proteins 
To see if the resulting distribution of scores is unusal we compare the distribution of scores for each protein with the scores from an equivalent randomised surface 
We can also examine the variation of the score for each patch over homologous proteins 
Here too we can compare the distribution of scores with scores generated from randomised sequences 
In the first case we find that the atomic patch score have distributions with shorter tails than those generated from the randomised surfaces indicating that the surface atoms are arranging themselves so as to avoid extrema of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity 
Perhaps more interestingly in the case of examining the hydrophobic patch score as it varys over sequences we find that hydrophobic patches tend to be supressed suggesting that surface residues can evolve in a collective fashion 
We argue that this confirms our initial hypothesis what its consequences are and some future research we can carry out 
I hope to see many of you at the talk

An easy to use interface that will allow users to control the level of spam that arrives in their NAME inbox will be introduced on NAME next week 
Note that we are not changing the central filtering rules at this stage only adding an NAME to messages coming into the University that will allow users to filter their own mail so that spam is delivered into a separate mailbox that may be examined at NAME 
More information including details of how to filter your messages to remove spam from your inbox on systems other than NAME can be found in recent editions of the NAME Service Newsletter 
WEBSITE 
As a result of this work there may be some interruptions to the flow of email during installation and final testing but this should only result in messages being delayed not lost or rejected

Starting my Project

NAME NAME 
If you do nt mind I have a few questions in regards to starting my NAME project 
Firstly I have assumed as I have nt heard any differently that I am being permitted to continue with the course even though my overall grade was C although will have to raise this to a B to pass the course 
Am I able to start my project before the start of the second year 
I know that I would like to do a project in a speech rather than a language area as this relates to my current job 
My employers have some ideas on the kind of areas they would like me to work on but I am not sure what the process is of making this official or finding someone to supervise me 
Should I submit a proposal to you and then a supervisor would be assigned or should I go through another route 
The preliminary discussions I have had about my project with my employers all relate to areas that would have a direct commercial use ie using existing recognisers in our case it would most likely be NuanceSMILEY and working on how to optimise their use in various situations 
Is a project along these lines acceptable

Re tokeniser
</SUBJECT>

What s the command line switch for using an exclusion list in the tokeniser 
And is there a similar one for the tagger 
The thing I showed you the other day was for the tagger NOT the tokeniser 
The syntax is CHAR fn where fn the file containing the exclusions 
The tokeniser is a standard flex bogstandard CHAR lexical analysergenerator program and as such would probably need to have the exclusions written into the lex file containing the lexical rules 
It is nt difficult to modify the lexer I ve made quite a few modifications for my dodgy email data and the whole thing compiles into a CHAR program so you could modify it to take a list of exclusions however I do nt think flex automatically generates an exclusion list feature although I could be wrong have a look at the online documentation 
I guess that s not great news but I hope you can do something with it

You can find NAME NAME including NAME at 
WEBSITE 
This package consists of NAME modules along with supporting NAME programs that implement the semantic similarity measures of NAME NUM NAME NUM NAME NUM NAME NUM NAME NAME NAME and NAME NUM 
The package contains NAME modules designed as object classes with methods that take as input NUM word senses from WordNet 
These methods can be embedded in any NAME program and will return the semantic similarity between the senses according to the requested measure 
There are also support programs for generating information content values NAME NUM for WordNet concepts from a variety of corpora including the NAME NAME NAME NAME or any raw text provided by a user 
The information content values are required by the measures of NAME NAME and NAME and could also be useful in a wide range of WordNet based applications 
The package also provides a simple command line interface that returns the similarity measure of NUM given words 
This is very similar to our earlier version of the Distance package 
A number of switches and options have been provided to enhance the output with trace data and other information 
Please download and give Similarity a try

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS 
The nd NAME NAME on Romance Corpus Linguistics will be dedicated to the questions how the methods and techniques of modern corpus linguistics can be put to use in order to investigate diachronic developments and language change and which innovative insights may result from the application of corpus linguistic methods in the field of historical linguistics 
Language change shall be considered in this context on different levels as longterm change that modifies profoundly the language CHAR involved even altering its their typologic structure processes the study of which require historical corpora of considerable extension and as medium and shortterm change that emerges already from the comparison of very few text or speaker generations and for which corpora with reduced diachronic depth are sufficient 
The workshop will include the following NUM panels 
Panel CHAR Corpus projects language data management and tools for analysis This panel will be open for the presentation of currently ongoing or completed corpus and database projects the main focus will be on projects with a historical perspective on long medium or shortterm language change 
Panel CHAR Corpusbased diachronic studies on Romance languagues For this panel contributions on diachronically oriented research on specific issues in Romance linguistics empirically based on corpora and databases are invited

Re Who speaks for who CHAR

Gosh you re quite right I do nt think any of us spotted that possibility 
Sorry 
But surely the fact that we did nt spot it shows it s not a likely reading 
Personally I hardly ever use may deontically I d always use can 
NAME 
At NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM you wrote 
As NAME surely a better form of wording could have been found 
the sentence we may speak for a large body of opinion in our field because we are the past presidents of the NAME is inherently ambiguous in just the way it seems the authors strove to avoid the modal auxiliary verb may is liable to be interpreted under its deontic reading ie we have permission are authorised to speak for a large body etc rather than under its intended epistemic reading it is possible that we speak for a large body etc 
It is precisely this ambiguity that makes me somewhat concerned that the letter s contents may be taken to have my support without my being consulted 
NAME NAME University of NAME 
NAME NAME wrote 
Dear NAME In this message I speak entirely for myself 
I understand why NAME and NAME objected to the letter that I signed along with all the other past presidents of the NAME since NUM 
There were actually one of us but the NAME lost count when it cut the list 
I m sorry they felt we were speaking or could be understood to be speaking for the NAME because that was certainly not my intention nor is it in my opinion even a reasonable interpretation of what we actually said 
We are writing as NAME in support of our colleague Professor NAME NAME who is currently under investigation by NAME for removing NUM NAME members of the editorial board of a journal she privately owns and publishes 
Although we write as individuals we may speak for a large body of opinion in our field because we are the past presidents of the Linguistics Association of NAME NAME since NUM 
All we said was we may speak for a large body of opinion 
Not that we 
did speak for a large body less still that we spoke for the whole of the NAME 
When I signed it I thought it was a reasonable assumption that since presidents are elected there must be quite a lot of people who accept them as similar in values etc When one of past presidents agree on something it seems likely that quite a few other members would agree on it as well 
Maybe I was wrong but I do nt think any of us know 
NAME asks why now No particular reason except that Christmas had been mentioned by NUM journalist as the deadline for the NAME inquiry 
Maybe we should have acted sooner 
Just to remind you of the points we did and did not make in the letter 
We did not make any judgement on NAME NAME s form of the boycott the rights and wrongs of this were nt at issue 
We did say NAME s treatment of her was over the top 
We did say we objected to NAME s assumption that it had the right to inquire into her private political activities 
Personally I stick by the last NUM of these points

Hi NAME NAME seems to be in a tizzy after his meeting with you 
I guess the point is for him to find a project that would let him develop some skills in corpus work independent of the framework he presents his results in 
Or did you really advise him not to do a thesis in NAME 
NAME 
Dear Doctor NAME 
I have just come back from my interview at NAME with Doctor NAME and Doctor NAME 
They agree to take me in They have asked me about what I would like to do for my summer project 
I tell them that I want to try testing my PhD project that is treating agreement as a function from semantic structures to syntactic structures with NAME 
But then I learn that Doctor NAME is basically a NAME person and Doctor NAME a Categorial Grammar person 
So I suggest something to do with the NAME system whose manual you have given me to have a look 
However Doctor NAME suggests that the best project for me in this summer would be something that requires me to use some unix tools to do some text searching extraction so that I can familiar myself with these skills normally possessed by NAME graduates 
Of course I know that this is only the methodology to do a project 
I still have to get a theme 
The problem is I know absolutely nothing about the methodology 
So I have no idea of what it is capable to do 
Can you suggest some reports of projects done by others for me to read so that I can get some ideas of what I can do 
Or do you have something that you find interesting 
Doctor NAME asks me to say hello to you 
I am looking forward to seeing you 
Enjoy your trip in NAME

NUM We need the name address and if applicable company no of the legal entity at NAME 
NUM NAME have asked whether they will be founder 
I do nt think that this makes any difference as pre emption rights ie shares are offered to the existing shareholders before being offered to new shareholders will be waived for the shares to be granted 
NUM I have been asked to redraft the wording under NUM For so long as NAME remains a shareholder in the Company for a period of up to NUM years from the date of this agreement The Company may grant NAME totalling between NUM NAME considers this to be ambiguous but I do nt see it 
NUM NUM CHAR between to be changes to up to OK with me but please check 
NAME has also asked that the wording be changed so that antidilution applies in the event of any issue of any shares to anybody presumably provided this falls below the pound k funding limit 
NAME NAME comment it seems to me that NAME will apply if shares are sold at a price to NAME and NAME at par value which is below market value howsoever that market value is caused eg purchase of NAME or price established by new investor purchasing at a premium 
I am not a tax expert 
To entirely resolve any tax issues we would have to employ a full blown shareholder s agreement having taken appropriate advice 
NUM days to decide whether to take up the shares is fine with me 
NUM iii The level of pound k is established as funds are difficult to obtain nowadays and onerous conditions are likely to be imposed 
NUM NAME has asked whether we could enter into a full shareholders agreement which could apply also to any new investor 
Generally I find that any substantive investor will wish to impose their own agreement whatever 
I should reiterate that the draft was created on the basis that there is a shortage of funds to pay for a complex agreement and that my instructions were on the basis that a short and straightforward version would do 
This is not designed with individual shareholder s interests such as tax effectiveness in mind and is an outline for discussion

NAME 
I have been tied up for the last few days but will get you a considered response in the next few days 
In principle it should be possible to tighten this clause up a bit to address your concern 
When do you expect the shareholders agreement to be ready for us to look at 
NAME 
Thanks for your responses 
I take the point about ensuring NAME is exploitable but am still uneasy over the rather vague wording 
Since we are already offering a noncommercial licence and plan to publicise a commercial one as soon as we incorporate perhaps a simple and easily verifiable condition that we do offer and continue to offer and publicise the offer of a nonexclusive commercial licence for the NAME software would suffice and be straightforwardly verifiable

CORPUS LINGUISTICS NUM 
NAME University UK NUM March NUM April NUM 
THIRD CALL FOR PAPERS AND WORKSHOPS 
Corpus Linguistics NUM will be a forum for all concerned with the computerassisted empirical analysis of natural language 
Our definition of corpus is broad and we therefore welcome those working on substantial literary texts or other kinds of text collection as well as more traditional corpus NAME 
Similarly we wish to encourage further crossfertilization between work occurring in language engineering eg information extraction parsing and linguistics 
We believe that corpus NAME should be aware of the late st developments in language processing 
We also believe that language engine ers should be aware of the findings and needs of corpus NAME 
The conference will include invited talks from NAME NAME NAME and the lexicon NAME NAME topic NAME NAME NAME topic NAME NAME NAME Everything you wanted to know about the American National Cor pus but were afraid to ask 
The aims of Corpus Linguistics NUM are 
NUM to encourage dialogue between those working on similar issues in diffe rent languages and between areas with a perhaps as yet untapped potential to interact 
NUM to encourage dialogue between researchers using corpora in linguistics and those using corpora in language engineering 
For the main conference pap ers of ca 
NUM minutes are invited on topics such as 
corpusbased studies of any language level in any language contrastive corpus linguistics computeraided studies of style corpus or textbased lexicography corpus text building encoding and NAME development of corpusbased language engineering tools applications of computeraided text analysis in nonlinguistic fields ma rket research advertising media studies sociology psychology etc Proposals for workshops half day or full day are also invited 
Topics broadly in line with the theme of the conference will be considered 
Workshops will be held on the th March 
The conference language will CHAR CHAR English

Re NAME special issue
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Hi NAME 
sorry I totally dropped the ball on this email 
I m finally just doing my grading for the semester and am cleaning up my mailbox and found this 
NAME I m swamped right now 
but I think it s a great idea I d love to have an issue on semantic parsing or NAME interpretation or something 
I ll start the process of talking to some of the other folks that are working on this and see if they think an issue would be interesting 
NAME 
NAME Wed NAME NUM NUM at NUM NAME NAME NAME wrote 
NAME 
As a member of the ed board of NAME Sp NAME I wonder if I can interest you in being editor of a special issue 
NAME NAME and I are actively encouraging submission of articles in stat 
NAME and I ve arranged for a special issue on NAME edited by NAME NAME and NAME NAME which shld appear nd quarter NUM hopefully capitalising on the output of Senseval 
However we wld like to have at least NUM more also signalling a shift of emphasis away from the signal processing lg modelling areas 
I do nt have a strong feeling for what I want the issue to cover but eg something in the statistical parsing area would be very appropriate 
The timescale wld probably be th quarter NUM so we d want final versions of all papers by Sept suggesting first submission deadline of around end of Jan for comfort 
Would you be prepared to edit such an issue 
this involves writing a word call for papers that wld both appear in the jnl and be sent to relevant lists arranging and participating in the refereeing process and writing a short intro to the issue 
You cld either do this alone or enlist another colleague eg NAME NAME 
It wld also be fine to submit a paper yourself see the recent special issue on generation in this case we wld arrange independent refereeing 
You cld count on my support throughout this process both in terms of liaising with NAME and assisting with the refereeing as I am sure wld the other relevantly qualified members of the editorial board NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME 
NAME handle the paper submission formatting and copy editing side of the process 
all the best

Re NUM Arrays
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Hi NAME 
Here s a little test prog I put together that shows a fairly easy way of using NUM arrays 
test 
sizexaxis NUM sizeyaxis NUM 
test NAME NUM NUM test NAME NUM NUM test NAME NUM NUM test NAME NUM NUM 
for x CHAR sizexaxis x for y CHAR sizeyaxis y print test x CHAR 
CHAR 
output 
NUM NUM NUM NUM 
NUM hashes are also very easy to use in a similar way 
The only funny thing about this is you only specify the size of the CHAR and CHAR axes for the purposes of looping the actual arrays are allocated dynamically and implicitly by perl 
Later 
CHAR 
Hi NAME 
I m supposed to meet NAME this afternoon so I ll be at the NAME 
I put something together as an attempt to implement the algorithm 
Could you have a look when you are free 
I m not at all certain how to give a NUM array 
Is there a way I could just use a CHAR like notation NAME x CHAR There was a suggestion on the web about a hash 
undef hash 
hash x y 
Is hash a reserved word or just StateArray 
Do you know whether it will work

Dear all 
As a part of a classified ads posting system a group of natural language processing students supervised by me have to develop a gross language detection system for the Spanish language 
I do not know if there is any work in this area except maybe NUM 
Dou you have ideas of how to do this 
It seems rather heuristic but my basic idea is 
NUM To build a dictionary of forbidden words CHAR CHAR etc 
NUM To develop a set of regular expresions that allow to detect variations of the forbiden words eg if xyzt is a forbidden word then we have to 
detect NAME NAME or little letter changes for slang CHAR CHAR instead 
CHAR CHAR etc 
Thank you for your help

Aims Scope of GRAMMARS 
GRAMMARS is an international forum for the dissemination of highlevel original research in the intersection between mathematical computational linguistics and formal language theory 
The journal is based on the fact that a certain gap exists between linguiststrying to find adequate formal tools for natural language description and computer scientistsoften unconcerned with the descriptive applicability of the generative devices they design 
The aim of the journal is to bring both communities together and to provide a platform for discussion

Hi NAME 
I ve read through the qa anaphora paper and here are some comments 
NUM Section NUM do you really mean that The NAME system recovers NAME representations 
NUM Tables and figures seem to be rather confused in the first half of the paper 
The NAME output should probably be NUM huge figure with a caption it does nt have one now and so it merges in with the table below it s also odd that you re referring to Figure NUM when you ve never referred to Figure NUM 
NUM Section NUM Table NUM gives the mean reciprocal rank This should be Table NUM 
NUM Section NUM unanswered questions by about NUM you need to backslash the sign 
NUM Section NUM weights selected are valid see Table NUM 
This should be Table NUM 
NUM Section NUM Why are the definite descriptions in Table NUM being referred to as interD can you not have intraD too 
How about NAME NAME the president of the club 
NUM Section NUM is not sufficient contx ie where Needs a sign between ie and where ie where

Re rasp subcat lexicon
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
OK we also have the M word American NAME Corpus now speak to NAME if you ca nt find it so it wld probably make sense to pull egs from this too 
NAME got back to me just now telling that we have nt got NAME yet 
The NAME website WEBSITE by autumn NUM 
We have got North American News Text corpus usr groups corporacds NAME but I do nt know if this is balanced enough 
NAME k sentence ver if we are talking k verbs or so is not a problem but gathering finding them maybe 
There are enough occurrences in NAME parsed egs for NUM out of NUM Comlex verbs usr groups dict subcat rasplexicon incomlex 
I selected a number of remaining underrepresented verbs from a few freq 
ranges and checked manually with NAME how many occurrences can be found in pdf ps documents 
I came up with the following statistics obviously not fully accurate but gives a rough idea 
NAME NAME NUM duplicate NUM NUM NUM reunite NUM NUM NUM rejoice NUM NUM NUM lighten NUM NUM 
NUM misjudge NUM NUM NUM absolve NUM NUM NUM computerize NUM NUM NUM sweeten NUM NUM 
NUM pacify NUM NUM NUM authenticate NUM NUM NUM amputate NUM NUM NUM resettle NUM NUM 
NUM overstep NUM NUM NUM embezzle NUM NUM NUM smarten NUM NUM NUM disinherit NUM NUM 
NUM overreach NUM NUM NUM reread NUM NUM NUM humanize NUM NUM NUM misquote NUM NUM 
NUM inundate NUM NUM NUM mispronounce NUM NUM NUM abominate NUM NUM reinsure NUM NUM 
NUM miscall NUM NUM piddle NUM NUM contemn NUM NUM declassify NUM 
NUM misconduct NUM NUM underspend NUM NUM dissatisfy NUM NUM calumniate NUM 
NUM disinfest NUM NUM asseveriate NUM 
some spellings verbs could be NAME here and explain higher freqs 
I think it would be good to either search data from internet for all the NUM underrepresented Comlex verbs in NAME ie all verbs marked with frequency less than NUM in usr groups dict subcat rasplexicon incomlex or set the NAME freq 
threshold very low NUM occurrences 
It might make sense to also set an upper bound on the highest freq 
verbs perhaps somewhere around NUM NUM NUM NUM raw occurrences 
I do nt think we need more than that and parsing will be faster when the data is not so huge 
Finally about the trip to NAME 
I asked NAME about the budget 
She gave the following figures 
NAME has a total of NAME NUM after NAME s trip NAME I has a total of NAME NUM 
Can we use NAME I for travels 
If so me going to NAME would exhaust NAME but leave some NUM in NAME I 
Perhaps still enough for you to attend NUM or one of the conferences next year

Re NAME
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Hi NAME 
I think it definitely makes sense for me to evaluate my thing on the NAME 
Subjects should be straightforward I ll read up on what NAME did for objects and obliques 
My algorithm is actually more involved than her baseline 
for example it looks like the base line would NAME anything at NUM position as a subject 
mine would nt if it was in a NAME or appositive 
similarly the basline would probably find an object relation between every verb and NAME in NUM position 
mine would nt if there was a relation with the next verb for example in he said the ball was NAME 
Also her evaluation is for all NAME 
My evaluation is for only NUM 
So I do nt think my NUM is incompatible with her baseline of NUM 
But it makes sense for me to evaluate against her as well for my thesis 
the reason I have confidence in my algo is that I ve been through the mistakes my anaphora resolution algorithm makes and they tend not to be due to incorrect NAME labelling 
I actually did the evaluation on the gold standard afterwards when I was writing the paper 
I m not claiming that an approach so shallow can handle all NAME but I think it will do ok even on the NAME for subjects and objects

Re NAME spam
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
I ve been using SpamNet for some time now so I thought I would give you an update on the performance 
NAME stopped NUM spam messages I ve blocked NUM spam messages NAME checked NUM NUM messages 
NAME NUM NUM false positives Recall NUM NUM false negatives 
NAME uses communitybased filtering WEBSITE The community is now more than half a million people 
There are NUM things I particularly like about NAME NUM It does not use filter rules 
You just install it and it works no tweaking rules 
NUM Its precision is perfect 
It has never blocked a message that was nt spam 
NAME 
I posted a plea for help with spam a while back so thought I d let you know what solution I ended up with 
My big constraint was that I get most of my mail through NAME NAME which requires an NAME connection to download mail over the open NAME 
That seemed at first to rule out a lot of spam solutions 
The first one I tried was NAME Inspector which creates and periodically updates a set of native ORG filtering rules 
This would be an elegant solution except that effectiveness was quite low 
I also found at least NUM bug in that it corrupted some of my existing filtering rules while producing whitelist rules from my address book 
I then decided to bit the bullet and deal with the NAME problem directly by installing stunnel WEBSITE is proxy that runs on a range of client machines 
It makes the NAME connection to external servers and provides a local server that provides a nonencrypted connection 
That opened up a range of spam filtering possibilities 
I ended up choosing POPFile WEBSITE It has a learning capability ability to write regrettably simplistic hard rules for handing mailing lists and relatively simple installation 
My impression was that NAME Assassin was harder to install but I also seriously considered that one 
I ve been using POPFile for about a day and have been quite impressed 
It uses naive NAME classification on words and on some aspects of the header and has a nice interface for labeling training data 
It operates as a proxy and can insert tags in the header and or subject lines so is compatible with any email program 
There s lots of ways it could be improved on both the usability and machine learning fronts but it s not bad at all and is already making my life much easier 
It only trains on those examples you tell it to and if I recall correctly the documentation encourages you to only train on examples it made a mistake on conservative training in NAME s sense 
NAME actually had a paper with somewhat murky results on conservative training of naive NAME classifiers 
inproceedings NAME author NAME NAME and NAME NAME title An Apobayesian Relative of NAME booktitle Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems NUM year NUM pages NUM editor NAME NAME and NAME NAME and NAME NAME publisher NAME NAME address NAME NAME 
It would be interesting to know more about how well naive NAME does with conservative training

To move forwards we need more information 
CHAR We will need the names of the guest editors to be appointed preferably NUM 
CHAR We need a draft schedule to publication so that we can identify the best issue to allocate to you 
I assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop

This looks to me like th quarter NUM or st quarter NUM 
CHAR A single issue of NAME will accommodate NUM or NUM papers 
To accommodate more we would have to make it a double issue 
How many papers do you anticipate accepting

Hi NAME I sent another email previous to this one but not sure if it got through 
if so ignore this email 
I had time to look over the article over the weekend and found a few corrections Section NUM Figure NUM not yet included probably know already section NUM table numbering wrong in paragraph NUM and NUM typo NAME vs NAME paragraph NUM should end something like number of unanswered questions by about NUM in training NAME SMILEY data 
I m not sure what you require in order to get the results for your NAME algorithm on the NAME NUM NAME contexts section NUM 
If you need result submission files then let me know which NUM and I can get them for you asap 
otherwise if you need to alter my code you can access my unix account using user name NAME passwd NUM 
I made a back up of my NAME directory in my home directory in a directory called NAME The NAME file lets you know which files are which the WEBSITE c file the options for which are in an appendix in my writeup 
To compile after changing the WEBSITE file just a script file to WEBSITE are example scripts that take a question number as input the position of the question s NAME structure in the compiled NAME file numbering starts from NUM 
I will be leaving tomorrow and it will take me a few days to get back over that side of the world 
but if you have any questions I ll check my email tonight and when I get back too 
I m not sure how much time I ll be able to spend on coding if you need me to interface with your code given this paper is due during exam time 
But I can probably come in and spend a morning in the labs with you if you need me to 
I hope that helps NAME

If you are making grant application to a Research Council which has a large equipment component please read on 
NAME have recently turned down such an application from NAME on the grounds that large items of equipment should be funded through the NAME Scientific Research Infrastructure Fund NUM initiative 
This is causing the University to think about allocating some of its NAME money for equipment possibly as much as M

Re NUM biologically inspired robots
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Theories of evolution of human cognition suggest very plausibly that the neocortex was evolved because of complex societies of our ancestors vertebrates with high neocortex body ratio have complex societies 
The society makes the individuals more complex their abilities make the society more complex And all characteristics of human cognition are strongly linked to social abilities eg abstractly think what the other is thinking I am thinking etc 
This causal link is nt clear 
It could just as easily be that larger brains evolved due to some other pressure enabled individuals to perform tasks leading to more complex social structures 
Yes in the beginning 
But once you have a complex society there is a positive feedback which presses the individuals to develop better social skills which in turn makes the society more complex and so on 
It would be interesting to see which constrains could break this feedback probably lack of environmental resources could limit population sizes or on the other hand if the resources are plenty enough and you are already clever enough you can survive being lazy and watch Big Brother all day

Re NAME NAME

Hey there 
NAME is an NAME document type it includes some features namely opening tags appearing without closing tags and attribute values appearing without surrounding quotation marks that do not constitute wellformed NAME 
NAME is precisely a version of NAME that has been designed to be conforming NAME 
The osx program part of the NAME package a successor to NAME NAME s sp package can automatically convert NAME files to corresponding NAME files you could give that a try 
NAME is maintained along with NAME WEBSITE 
I believe osx is written in C 
You should be able to validate the resulting NAME documents against the NAME NAME although I would imagine you ll need to make minor changes for full validity 
NAME that helps

Re NAME Corpus Sanitation
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Another comment on anonymisation 
The problem is even worse if one wishes to make available for whatever purpose the audio or video tapes from which transcriptions have been prepared 
I believe that considering this more challenging case also clarifies issues for textonly corpora 
I ll assume video which is the extreme point 
There are NUM problems with video 
No amount of signal manipulation however small preserves the full scientific usefulness of the data 
On the other hand no reasonable amount of anonymisation however large really ensures anonymity 
The first point is obvious if one contemplates trying to do psycholinguistic experiments with the data 
It would for example seriously compromise a comprehension study if proper names are bleeped out or even replaced by others 
No psychology reviewer would ever accept that such data is as naturalistic as untreated data 
The second point is almost as obvious because humans are adept at inferring personal identity from all kinds of things including voice quality ear shape gait and so on 
Therefore whatever NUM does short of blanking everything out it is difficult to credibly claim that the risk of unintended identification has been avoided 
NAME NAME s NAME documentation makes the case that such identification is highly undesirable 
The only way I can see to handle this is to deal with the problem at the outset by making completely clear to participants what will happen to their data and obtaining informed consent 
If this is not done the data is effectively lost to responsible researchers and cannot be used except at risk of infringing participants rights 
If as in the case NAME has promises have been made to participants those promises must be honoured 
It may or may not be possible to recover data that is both useful and distributable under these circumstances 
The same difficulties are also present for audio the NAME audio has never been distributed even though it exists 
The risk of identification is just too great and the consequences of that too severe to be acceptable 
Although the visual cues to identity are absent speaking style persists 
One may feel that the risks are less but they still exist 
And here s the rub the same arguments apply albeit more weakly to textonly corpora 
While voice quality is now absent substantial cues to personal identity may persist in lexis and other idiosyncrasies not to mention that people are extremely adept at reconstructing material from context 
Once again the risks are arguably less than in the other media but they still exist 
So notwithstanding valiant efforts to anonymise in such a way that the scientific usefulness of the data is preserved the original decision to promise anonymity comes back to haunt us 
I lean to the view that there is no difference of principle between the different media 
Is even NAME s rigorous approach to anonymization enough in practice 
Perhaps but that depends on a very iffy judgement call 
The lesson seems to be that great care is needed in collecting informed consent for corpus work 
None of this addresses the additional point made in NAME s post about collateral damage to people and organisations not involved in the recording 
I could imagine a prosecution against both participants and corpus distributors for defamation or slander 
That would be bad 
Perhaps corpus collectors need to indemnify participants against this or perhaps it suffices to warn people that they are in effect speaking in a public place 
Or perhaps we have a duty of care to ensure that our participants do not put themselves at risk doubly likely since many corpora include contributions by children 
And that leaves aside the much more likely cases where nasty stuff in the corpus evokes resentment and unhappiness but not enough to lead to prosecutions

Dr NAME NAME Assistant Professor of Computational Linguistics Department of Linguistics NUM NAME Avenue NAME OH NUM NAME NUM NUM NUM NAME NUM NUM NUM Web WEBSITE 
On NAME NAME s posting to me there is an important difference between bad language and individuals names or information that could lead to identification of individuals 
Like NAME NAME I do nt believe there is any real reason to censor the bad language it is important linguistic data and we are all grownups 
But I do think that before such a resource is made public strenuous efforts should be made to eliminate any possibility of users identifying either the individuals who produced the material or any individuals or individual institutions written about 
Actually under various national Data Protection laws I suspect it might be illegal not to do this even if the material is simply held at NUM institution and not circulated 
But it ought to be done anyway for reasons that I discuss at some length in the ethics section of the documention file accompanying my NAME Corpus available via the Web from my home page WEBSITE CHRISTINE 
I discuss there what seems to me to have been inadequate practice in this respect in the spoken section of the British National Corpus 
There are places where really damaging things are said in a quite casual way in conversation about people or organizations who which might easily be identified by people who know them and could probably be identified by strangers with only minimal detective work 
The recorded speakers had no motive to worry about this but I believe corpus NAME have a responsibility not to let such casual gossip about identifiable people be turned into permanent public records

NAME NAME NAME NAME

Dative alternation 
E 
b NAME made NAME a cake 
VP vform NUM io NAME vform NUM none NAME NUM ditrans NP 
This verb phrase dative alternation is of an indirect object form without a preposition pharse 
vform of the NAME node is set to none so no recursion occurs 
VP vform NUM none NAME NUM ditrans CHAR NP 
The NAME rule for the ditrans valence with vform NUM none needs to be specified as above for the first rule to work 
CHAR NAME made a cake for NAME 
VP vform NUM ioprep NAME vform NUM none NAME NUM ditrans PP 
This verb phrase dative alternation is of an indirect object form with a preposition at the end specifying the the recepient 
Again vform NUM none in the NAME node so that no recursion occurs 
E 
Transitive intransitive contrast 
E 
CHAR NAME broke the window CHAR The window broke 
NAME can subcategorise in NUM ways as transitive and intransitive 
We have thought of NUM ways of dealing with this 
NUM By thinking about broke as a transitive verb that looses it s subject agent in CHAR and then uses the object in the subject position 
We say that certain verbs have the property of being able to swap agent 
in this way and indicate this with an extra attribute in the lexical entries 
broke NAME swagDyes valDtrans drop NAME swagDyes valDtrans improve swagDyes valDtrans 
The rules below try to capture this in that a gap may occur after such a 
verb 
CHAR NAME NAME gapDnp NAME gapDnp CHAR swagDyes NAME gapDnp NAME gapDnp CHAR 
NUM the other way By thinking of broke as a verb that can be both transitive and intransitive

Very rare terms elimination
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Dear all 
I have seen in several paper that very rare terms eg those ocurring in 
less than NUM to NUM documents are often deleted from the representation of documents for text categorization 
I am on the need of doing the same because I am working now on a big number of documents for a binary classification problem and the indexing of documents for learning is qui te slow 
According to NAME s law if you delete terms ocurring in less than CHAR documents you will get much less terms and indexing will be much faster 
After indexing I am applying term selection with Information Gain 
I plan to keep about NUM to NUM of the original terms 
If I prevoiusly delete those ocurring in less than CHAR documents I will probably not miss any top scoring term but I would like to have a theoretical background to so it safely 
So is there any theoretical result that allows to delete terms occurring 
in less than CHAR documents that supports there will be no miss of information for a rather balanced and large binary classification dataset 
Thank you

Dear all 
I m working on an NAME NAME System Can somebody point me to any system for translating NAME to NAME In NAME 
NAME NAME is a form of NAME is nt it 
For converting between different NAME specs as defined by a NAME or NAME NAME you should take a look at NAME NAME transforms 
This is an XMLbased programming language 
There are quite a few NAME processors out there that include NAME libraries such as Saxon and NAME 
You write the NAME and apply the NAME to the input NAME to generate the output NAME

Dear Fellows and Staff 
A number of you have asked for guidance on whom to contact in College now that we have no Domestic NAME 
I am hoping to compile an indexed guide during the NAME but for now perhaps the following will be of help 
Most aspects of college life previously coordinated by the Domestic NAME are now being run by Heads of Departments and coordinated through the Heads of Departments Committee 
I have listed individual members below with job titles and contact details 
If you prefer you may contact NAME NAME who is the secretary to the committee email EMAIL or NAME NUM and she will put items of business onto the next committee agenda or if urgent forward them to the appropriate departmental head 
NAME is the Maintenance secretary and uses the Maintenance pigeonhole in College 
The Heads of NAME WEBSITE chair of the committee is the NAME NAME and he attends Council on behalf of the committee 
Heads of Departments who previously reported to the Domestic NAME now report to the NAME and I act as a sort of gobetween 
I hope this is helpful do let me know if you need any other information at this stage or if you are aware of any aspects of college life not covered by the new arrangement

A Computational Model for Lexical Acquisition of a Categorial Grammar 
A model of lexical acquisition has been developed in order to learn both the semantic and syntactic category of lexemes associated with a generalised categorial grammar 
Computational simulation shows that acquisition is possible when some prior language knowledge is assumed 
The effects on acquisition have been explored when aspects of this prior knowledge are varied 
At this conference CHAR would present the acquisition model focusing particularly on the novel syntax learner as well as the results of acquisition experiments that have been run from different starting points in terms of the prior knowledge assumed 
In child language acquisition theory it has been suggested that children have an innate ability to recognise the category of particular types of words and this ability in turn helps them to determine the category of other words 
Whether this innate ability to categorise applies to names and object words or actions words has been much discussed 
The difference in acquisition rate in each case is investigated 
The method assumes a pipelined approach to acquisition 
Each utterance in turn is first processed for the acquisition of semantic information and subsequently for the acquisition of syntactic information 
It is assumed that this is compatible with children s behaviour 
It is likely that children acquire all the information they can from an utterance when they hear it and then discard it 
It would be impractical for the child to store many utterances to process later 
The syntactic learner relies on output from the semantic learner 
This also echos children s behaviour since they pass through a single word acquisition phase before they begin to acquire syntax 
The semantic learner produces a mapping between words and their semantic representation using amongst others the theories of crosssituational learning and covering constraints and is based on NAME s work on NAME NAME Techniques 
A fundamental assumption is employed to link the NUM learners the number of words that the semantic category of a word is dependent upon is the same as the number of words that the syntactic category is dependent upon 
The syntactic learner attempts to create valid parse trees for the categorial grammar thus resolving unknowns in the syntactic category types 
This is achieved by first assigning skeleton categories to words in the current utterance using the fundamental assumption in conjunction with information already extracted by the semantic learner 
All possible binary tree structures for the utterance are then considered 
NAME trees are discarded whilst any valid trees add weighting to the syntactic categories of words at their leaf nodes 
For a very simple example consider the sentence The grinch cries 
Using the scenario where children have an innate ability to recognise names and objects we already know that 
grinch is of semantic category NAME and syntactic category CHAR 
In order to find a skeleton category for the remaining words we look at their semantic category and then apply the fundamental assumption 
the has semantic category THE CHAR and syntactic category xy cries has semantic category NAME CHAR and syntactic category uv 
where is used to represent either forward or backward application and CHAR CHAR CHAR CHAR are syntactic categories which may be either atomic or complex 
A possible parse tree for this sentence is 
CHAR 
uv cries xy CHAR The NAME 
The syntax learner could then discover the following unknowns 
CHAR CHAR sx cries CHAR CHAR CHAR The NAME 
The input to the system is a collection of utterances paired with semantic representations 
These semantic representations are the hypothesised meanings a child may assume for an utterance 
The correct interpretation may or may not be included amongst the semantic representations 
The affect of this type of noise on the system may also be investigated 
Children learn their native tongue because it is the language of their environment 
In the early stages of acquisition the only language that children are exposed to is that of their caketakers 
This implies that the caretakers utterances are the only input needed to begin acquisition 
To mirror this situation from which children actually learn I use real data the interaction between a child and her parents 
Since the child involved did successfully learn English it is reasonable to assume that the utterances the child heard the parents say are sufficient for learning provided a capable model and correct starting assumptions can be found 
The NAME s Corpus of the NAME database has been used for this work 
The corpus contains a selection of interactions between a child and her parents from the age of NUM year NUM month to NUM years and NUM month 
The corpus has been preprocessed by NAME 
All phonological annotations and grammatical structures not covered by her grammar including interjections and elliptical material have been removed 
The child s sentences were also excluded from those remaining so that the parents sentences only are given as input to the system 
The learner has been run on the first NUM utterances of the corpus 
The semantics learner will currently achieve recall of NUM with precision NUM 
The syntactic learner is dependant upon the recall of the semantic learner in that it can only proceed when a skeleton syntactic category is available for every word in the utterance when this is the case the success rate is high with precision in the high NAME 
A previous investigation into lexical acquisition in the framework of a categorial grammar was discussed by NAME 
His approach differs from this in several respects 
NAME s syntactic learner was entirely algebraic in nature the syntactic categories were derived by solving a set of simultaneous equations 
In order to constrain his search space NAME had to specify the syntactic categories allowed 
This meant defining a category set before learning began 
This is equivalent to assuming a child has innate knowledge of which syntactic categories are allowed in it s language 
The learner presented here is not restricted in this way 
NAME s learner was used in conjunction with a parameter setting system NAME in order to NAME hypothesised category sets 
For this purpose the learner was successful but NAME still made several assumptions that would correspond to innate language ability in a child 
In order to investigate these assumptions a new learning model is needed 
The learner presented can acquire language from reasonably little prior knowledge and as a result the effects on learning rate as introduced by these and other assumptions can be investigated

<BODY>
CORPUS LINGUISTICS NUM 
NAME University UK NUM NUM March NUM 
CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS 
Corpus Linguistics NUM will be a forum for all concerned with the computerassisted empirical analysis of natural language 
Our definition of corpus is broad and we therefore welcome those working on substantial literary texts or other kinds of text collection as well as more traditional corpus NAME 
Similarly we wish to encourage further crossfertilization between work occurring in language engineering eg information extraction parsing and linguistics 
We believe that corpus NAME should be aware of the latest developments in language processing 
We also believe that language engineers should be aware of the findings and needs of corpus NAME 
The conference will include invited talks from NAME NAME Corpora and the lexicon NAME NAME topic NAME NAME NAME NAME phrase or function a comparison between frame semantics and local grammars NAME NAME Everything you wanted to know about the American National Corpus but were afraid to ask 
There will be NUM preconference workshops 
CorpusBased Approaches to Figurative Language Learner Corpora Design Development and NAME NAME Corpora Linguistic Requirements and Technical Perspectives Shallow Processing of Large Corpora NAME NUM 
Details of the workshops and the more than NUM accepted papers and posters are available on the conference website 
WEBSITE 
The aims of Corpus Linguistics NUM are 
NUM to encourage dialogue between those working on similar issues in different languages and between areas with a perhaps as yet untapped potential to interact 
NUM to encourage dialogue between researchers using corpora in linguistics and those using corpora in language engineering

NAME 
This workshop clearly falls within the scope of NAME and my initial reaction to your email is very positive 
To move forwards we need more information 
CHAR We will need the names of the guest editors to be appointed preferably NUM 
CHAR We need a draft schedule to publication so that we can identify the best issue to allocate to you 
I assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop 
You then need to give them time to produce the full paper send it out to referees allow revisions final review and accept 
This looks to me like th quarter NUM or st quarter NUM 
CHAR A single issue of NAME will accommodate NUM or NUM papers 
To accommodate more we would have to make it a double issue 
How many papers do you anticipate accepting 
If you can answer the above then the editors can make a final decision 
Note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular submissions to NAME 
Each accepted paper must have been reviewed by NUM independent reviewers 
The guest editors make the accept reject decision but one of the regular NAME editors is assigned to assist in the process probably me in this case 
If you have detailed questions about publication procedures please contact NAME van der NAME at NAME for email see cc list 
NAME 
NAME 
I ve been asked to followup some previous emails copied below 
In brief NAME NUM and NAME NAME NAME NUM workshops are seeking a journal special issue 
The relevant NAME is attached 
In essence we d like to repeat the successful previous NAME practice selected papers for a journal SI 
Last time it was with NAME and this time we d like a more speech related one our first preference being NAME 
A key factor is publication date this should be as soon after NAME date NAME NUM as possible 
What are your thoughts 
I ve attached below some history emails

Hi NAME and NAME 
Thank you for letting me know your thoughts and plans 
We are pursuing publication options in parallel and are still very interested in NAME 
We look forward to hearing further from NAME after you ve had a chance to talk 
Would you like any additional information from us

NAME I m sorry for the delay in response 
I m actually stepping down from being editor of NAME at the end of June so I m not sure that I should have much of a role in the decision 
I m ccing NAME on this email and will try to talk to him about it in the next couple weeks 
We were interested earlier but we are getting a bit of a backlog so we need to look at that to assess whether the timing still makes sense 
NAME 
Hi NAME 
I believe that we approached you some time ago to investigate the possibility of a special issue of the Computer Speech Language journal on NAME NUM The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop I ve attached the draft NAME with more details 
Given that the NAME NAME NUM Workshop will be held in conjunction with NAME NUM we might want to consider including papers from both workshops in the special issue I recall you being favorable to our query although we had not yet formulated a real proposal 
Can you still accommodate us 
If so under what parameters conditions eg turn around time page count page size guest editor CHAR 
Are you also working under NAME van der NAME and if so would you like me to ask her about this 
We published a special issue of NAME journal using an expedited roundrobin review process on the NAME Speaker NAME NAME NUM that was published as almost NUM NAME NAME pages in a triple volume within only a few months 
I think the quality of the papers was reasonably good although we might have erred on accepting a few too many papers for the special issue and disrupting NAME s page quotas for that year 
There was a special issue of Speech Communication on an NAME predecessor workshop but that took much longer too long to publish 
I ve included an excerpt from some discussions on these pros and cons and would like to know if you agree with this assessment especially with respect to NAME 
Sincerely NAME 
choices in addition that will be eg NAME 
I m not for things with this long of a delay 
I like moving to journals with reasonable turn around time as long as they are not too far from main stream 
NAME NAME seems like a nice one to try

Hi NAME a quick question 
I have been looking at perplexity values for the LMs I ve generated and I find that on the whole the test set perplexities for the bigrams are significantly higher than for the unigrams 
This is undoubtedly due to the fact that whenever a bigram is unseen I backoff to the unigram distribution but since the probabilities are calculated over the discounted probability mass they are much lower than in the standard unigram case 
However the bigrams still perform significantly better because even though the backedoff unigram probabilities are much smaller they are still correctly proportioned 
Thus it seems that comparing perplexities for different ngrams is basically pointless what do you think

I m being asked to offer feedback through the royal academy of engineering on government policy on HE 
see below 
I d appreciate any comments anyone has 
I nearly missed this as the NAME Lock in the original subject line below triggered a high level of spam SMILEY 
Forwarded Message 
To EMAIL EMAIL Subject THE FUTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION From Dr NAME NAME NAME CHAR Manager Engineering Policy NAME Wed NUM NAME NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM 
The Future of Higher Education 
The government recently released its White Paper on the Future of Higher Education an extensive document detailing its proposals to restructure and fund the HE sector over the next NUM years building up what it claims to be a radical picture of a freer future 
The report can be accessed on the website of the Department for Education and Skills at WEBSITE 
Although media attention has focussed on deferred financial contributions from graduates and allowing institutions to set their own course fees the paper also covers many other areas regarding the expansion funding and assessment of higher education institutes 
There are many points that could be made about the proposed reforms but the most important issues are presented in the attached annex 
It is believed important that The NAME NAME of Engineering should comment on the White Paper and I am writing to a number of Fellows seeking views from which a response may be prepared 
The attached outline should be used as a guide although please do not feel that it is necessary to comment on all areas as we are aware that it is extensive 
Any additional points you have to make regarding the White Paper would be most welcome 
I would appreciate if any responses could reach me by Monday th March and look forward to hearing your opinions on this matter 
Yours 
NAME NAME 
NUM Expansion 
a Must the sector expand any further 
Are there benefits in having NUM of the population aged NUM undertake a University degree 
b The government s initiatives to promote fair access include reforming the funding scheme providing grants for students from lower income families and appointing an independent Access Regulator to oversee admissions 
Are these measures enough 
What should the government do to promote fair access to higher education 
c Is the appointment of an independent Access Regulator welcomed 
d The bulk of expansion will be towards more twoyear workfocused foundation degrees 
Are these a good idea 
NUM Education and the Business Economy 
a The report makes much of harnessing knowledge to wealth creation 
Is the present government s focus on the financial benefits of a university education and financial returns from university research damaging 
Can the benefits of academia whether research or teaching be measured in purely financial terms 
b In order to encourage the transfer of knowledge and technologies between academia and business the government is setting up a network of Knowledge Exchanges and increasing the funding to the Higher Education Innovation Fund 
Are such initiatives worthwhile or would the funding be better spent in other ways 
NUM Funding of Infrastructure and Teaching 
a The government is aiming to undo the years of underinvestment in higher education 
This is to be accomplished by increasing the funding available by more than NUM percent over the next NUM years developing incentives to support and improve research investing more in leading research departments and increasing spending on research 
Are these measures enough 
Are the figures the government provides enough to reverse the trend of under investment in this sector 
b Should universities be allowed to set their own fees or Graduate Contributions per course 
Is it fair to tie such fees to an Access NAME 
CHAR 
Can the government do more to encourage the creation of endowment funds 
NUM Student Finance 
a Are the proposals for student finance fair 
Is it reasonable to ask students to contribute to their education by paying fees 
Is a deferred contribution the best way to administer this 
b NAME the current proposals to increase student debt act as a deterrent to students contemplating entry into higher education 
Is the introduction of higher levels of student debt at odds with the governments aim to increase access to universities 
c The proposals for student debt do not take into consideration the fact that a large proportion of women take career breaks to raise a family 
With the average salary for women graduates lower than that of men this would mean that most women would take longer to pay back their student debts than their male counterparts 
Does the governments proposals for deferred contributions disadvantage women 
NUM Research Assessment 
a The government aims to develop criteria to assess the strength and quality of research 
Is this necessary or welcomed 
Should the government be directly involved in the choice of the type of research that is funded 
b Is creating a new NUM category in the Research Assessment Exercise necessary 
NUM 
Teaching 
a The government has proposed new national professional standards for teaching and a new body to develop and promote good teaching the NAME NAME NAME 
Are these welcomed 
b The government has proposed a national training programme for external examiners 
Is this necessary 
c The University title will be made dependent on teaching degree awarding powers meaning it will no longer be necessary to have research degree awarding powers to become a university 
Is it wise to divorce teaching and research in this manner 
Should a University have to award research as well as teaching degrees 
d Is there a demand for the establishment of an independent adjudicator to deal with student complaints 
Should government provide legislation for this 
NUM Are there any other points that you think should be raised regarding this paper

NAME is a very important component in Natural Language Processing 
It still raises many problems for instance at the level grammatical formalisms or at the level of the algorithmic complexity especially to handle ambiguity 
However because of recent advances parsers are nowadays more and more widely used in large scale applications 
Many approaches exist in the NAME community that differ on the methods and objectives 
The methods include for instance stochastic parsing local parsing cascades or more traditional complete or deep parsing 
NAME range from segmentation into chunks to deep parsing based on wide coverage grammars including shallow and or robust parsing 
Anyway these various methods and objectives are not necessarily in opposition and may be perceived as complementary 
Despite the large number of existing grammatical formalisms there are hints of convergences between them which open ways for partial conversions between formalisms for instance between NAME and NAME or NAME and NAME or toward operational formalisms 
Also some parsing techniques are generic and may be applied for several formalisms 
Some parsing systems also aim to be multiformalisms relying on generic and efficient infrastructures indexing memory management by structure sharing or copying powerful unification 
Finally the notion of lexicalization is present in most formalisms 
Last but not least the generalization of parsers raises the issue of their evaluation 
NAME 
The main objective of this special issue is a better understanding of the various approaches and techniques found in NAME highlighting the convergences and complementarities that may exist between them 
We welcome works on any of the following issues 
Convergence between grammatical formalisms conversions of formalisms operational formalisms vs declarative NUM 
Convergence and complementarity in parsing approaches robustness unknown words error corrections lexicalization Integration of stochastic methods Cascade parsing vs onepass parsing 
Evolution of parsing techniques for new formalisms

Human Language Technology for the Semantic Web and Web Services 
WEBSITE 
Workshop at NAME NUM International Semantic Web Conference NAME Island NAME NUM October NUM 
NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME 
The Semantic Web aims to add a machine tractable repurposeable layer to compliment the existing web of natural language hypertext 
In order to realise this vision the creation of semantic NAME the linking of web pages to ontologies and the creation evolution and interrelation of ontologies must become automatic or semiautomatic processes 
In the context of new work on distributed computation Semantic Web Services NAME go beyond current services by adding ontologies and formal knowledge to support description discovery negotiation mediation and composition 
This formal knowledge is often strongly related to informal materials 
For example a service for multimedia content delivery over broadband networks might incorporate conceptual indices of the content so that a smart NAME such as next generation NAME can reason about programmes to suggest to its owner 
Alternatively a service for NAME catalogue publication has to translate between existing semistructured catalogues and the more formal catalogues required for NAME purposes 
To make these types of services costeffective we need automatic knowledge harvesting from all forms of content that contain natural language text or spoken data 
Other services do not have this close connection with informal content or will be created from scratch using Semantic Web authoring tools 
For example printing or compute cycle or storage services 
In these cases the opposite need is present to document services for the human reader using natural language generation 
This workshop will provide a forum for workers in the field of human language technology for the Semantic Web and for Semantic Web Services to present their latest results 
The aim is to provide a snapshot of the state of the art dealing with a wide range of issues including but not limited to 
automatic and semiautomatic NAME of web pages 
semantic indexing and retrieval of documents combining the strengths of NAME and NAME 
integration of data about language in language processing components with ontological data 
robustness across genres and domains 
ease of embedding in Semantic Web applications 
ontology learning evolving and merging 
automatic web service description augmentation 
automatic semantic structure documentation 
language technology for automatic Web service discovery 
adaptation of generation techniques to NAME applications 
The themes of the workshop have partly emerged from the Special Interest Group on Language Technologies and the Semantic Web SIG part of the NAME thematic network WEBSITE 
NAME 
The issues addressed by the workshop are at the core of the Semantic Web enterprise 
The killer applications that demonstrate the potential of this technology to a mass market have yet to emerge and will likely not do so until a much larger amount of data is available 
The techniques covered by this workshop are one of the most important routes to generating this data 
The workshop is relevant to 
researchers from the Human Language Technology areas 
researchers from the Ontology and Knowledge Acquisition and Management areas 
industrial technology providers involved in Knowledge Management Information Integration Information and Library Science Web Services

Re NAME NAME recall NUM point for NAME NAME classifier
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
On Mon NAME NUM NUM at NUM NUM NAME NUM NAME NAME wrote 
I wonder whether the original poster NAME NAME may have misunderstood the advice from NAME NAME 
His phrase regardless of the absolute values of the scores suggests to me that he is actually choosing the class with the highest NAME NAME without normalizing to get the posterior probability 
Yes that s what I m doing 
That s fine as a way of getting the same result faster 
NAME may be saying that it seems fishy to threshold on the numerator 
No I m not saying that although or because I agree that it does not make sense to compare the raw numerators 
What I was wondering about was whether it would make much sense to threshold on the posterior probabilities when the posterior probabilities are unreliable because of violated independence assumptions 
Indeed one should not do that as numerators are nt comparable across examples 
The right thing to do is to threshold on the posterior probability as NAME said or equivalently manipulate the prior as NAME NAME said

Re NAME

the current web page for projects says 
It would also be helpful if you could indicate any special software hardware or data 
could nt we make this mandatory 
the examiners will have to ask if this information is nt given 
In any case we need an explicit declaration that no special resources are required when they are nt just to cover ourselves 
NAME could you liaise with NAME or someone to get a spec for a special resources form which is acceptable to the sysadmins 
In general the proposer of the project is also the supervisor however for projects with an industrial supervisor or doctoral researcher as supervisor we are required to appoint a second internal supervisor 
My belief is that this only applies to predoctoral researchers 
The Examiners therefore reserve the right to modify both the content and working arrangements of a project 
Any changes of this nature which are felt necessary would however be discussed with the proposer beforehand 
please change this to 
The Examiners may ask the proposer to modify the content and working arrangements of a project

may want 
this has proved very successful in the past and we do like to encourage this sort of involvement

Re NAME overhead projectors
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
As a metacomment to the current issue I suspect the NAME projectors get moved because someone using the NAME projectors finds they get in the way 
A really nice longterm solution is to arrange that the NUM desks on which the projectors sit just have a camera above or below so that images written in realtime can be projected onto the NUM NAME projectors 
As I am sure many will remember the original design had no overhead projectors at all but that we should have visualisers which is just the name for what you propose instead 
Nobody was able or willing to demonstrate to us one that worked acceptably

Re NAME Corpus Sanitation

All 
As academics we would like to leave the data entirely uncorrupted so we d rather not anonymise but then ethical issues mean for some purposes we have to 
Exactly the same applies to bad taboo as NAME marks it language 
I have datasets I d like to give easy access to for language learners 
Do I want children NAME people accessing my website CDROM to encounter taboo language 
Will I be exposed to lawsuits from shocked parents if I do 
Like anonymisation it s hard 
Throwing out sentences texts with taboo words or strings is at least straightforward you can find them without exhaustive reading 
But as with anonymisation where there are no explicit names there are taboo texts without taboo words so if you want to be confident you are not disseminating taboo language if you re sources aim to cover the breadth of language use an awful lot of reading is required 
I recently had a conversation with a dictionary publisher facing the same predicament yes he did an awful lot of reading

Dear All 
I was interested to read in the recent posting to the list by NAME NAME see below that he was uncertain as to whether he should make his corpus publicly available because it contained some uncensored words NAME s point NUM 
I guess that this means bad language I assume it does not relate to anonymization issues as they are covered in NAME s point NUM If this is about bleeping out words in corpora should nt we encourage NAME not to do this 
Surely we want corpora to contain uncensored speech 
The point for me of using corpora is to describe account for language as it is rather than language as we wish it to be 
Best 
NAME 
Dear all 
I got several responses asking if I am planning to make my question list public 
I think I should answer this question to the whole list 
I am willing to make it public but I am not sure if I should do it right now 
Here are the reasons 
NUM Some questions ask information about specific people not only celebrities but also probably the questioners or other people with very close relationships to the questioners 
This may raise some privacy issues 
I prefer to take off these questions before make the question corpus public 
NUM Some questions actually not a small number contain some uncensored words 
I think these questions are improper to be in a corpus 
NUM Many questions are not grammatically correct or with some spell errors 
I personally think this is ok becaues the questions are from real world 
I do nt know what other researchers think about this 
NUM Different researchers may have different expections 
For example the original poster of this thread required why and how questions other people have asked about statistic information on specific phrase groups 
I would like to know if there are some common requirements from most or many researchers 
NUM After I do something to the question archive and make it public I am thinking of updating the public question corpus time to time 
More efforts have to take and I am not sure if I have enough energy to do this 
I hope some NUM is willing to join me 
I am waiting for your inputs 
Especially if you are willing to do something for building the corpus I am happy to work with you 
Many thanks

Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION 
NAME editors NAME NAME EMAIL NAME NAME EMAIL 
The process of automatically determining the meanings of words word sense disambiguation NAME is an important stage in language understanding 
It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation information retrieval mono and crosslingual corpus analysis summarization and document navigation 
The importance of NAME has been acknowledged since the s and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of NAME an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision recall comparison of participating systems which has been run twice to date 
The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible 
This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on handcrafted disambiguation rules 
This special issue of NAME NAME due for publication in April NUM is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation 
Papers are invited on all aspects of NAME research and especially on 
Combinations of methods and knowledge sources 
Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information 
How should they be combined 
Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources 
Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another 
Evaluation of NAME systems 
Which metrics are most informative and would new NUM be useful 
Can NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task for example parsing 
Can evaluations using different data sets corpora and lexical resources be compared 
Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods 
Sense distinctions and sense inventories 
How do these affect NAME 
How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the NAME task 
Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text 
What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done 
The effect of NAME on applications 
To what extent does NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval 
What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications 
What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes 
Minimising the need for handtagged data 
NAME text is expensive and difficult to obtain while untagged text is plentiful and effectively limitless 
What techniques can be used to make use of untagged text would weakly semisupervised learning algorithms be useful 
What use can be made of parallel text 
Can untagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text

NAME 
Re the second mail I sent you just interpolating the log probs I vaguely remember that the log scale represents the amount of bits required for information to be transferred in addition to the property that it scales nicely 
So if you are working on this domain you have a good argument to be interpolating directly in that space logs 
NAME 
On NAME NUM NAME NUM NAME NAME wrote 
OK the problem is this 
I ve already got log CHAR CHAR and log CHAR CHAR because I m calculating probabilities in log space to avoid underflow 
Thus I have to find the equivalent of interpolating in the normal probability space 
NAME is that normal interpolation requires addition which does nt have an equivalent in the log space 
Thus the only thing I can think of is to scale and convert back to normal probs but this still might cause problems with under overflow if the probabilities are markedly different 
Any further ideas I d be grateful

opinion re letter to NAME

<BODY>
Dear NAME list I have no personal stake whatsoever in the boycott of NAME academic institutions and indeed have recently served as a referee for a research proposal with links to NAME 
Like many other contributors to this debate I am not myself convinced that action against individals with connections to NAME is right or even effective 
However I support the letter written by Professor NAME and others to the NAME questioning the appropriateness of the action taken against Professor NAME NAME 
For anyone who might not have seen the NAME webpage statement I have cut and pasted it below 
The homepage asserts that her decision was wrong 
According to how I understood it the letter sent to the NAME by Professor NAME and others expressed concern that she may have already been in some sense condemned before the inquiry conducted by NAME is concluded 
Their lack of engagement with the boycott issue per se was I thought rather clear I was nt surprised to discover subsequently that some though not all of them were in fact signatories of a petition opposing an academic boycott of NAME 
I would like to thank those past presidents for their courageous action in support of a fellow academic 
In my view they were simply upholding a basic principle of fair treatment within a NAME HE institution to which I would hope we would all subscribe 
My genuine apologies if I have offended anyone who finds this matter of how NAME NAME has been treated inseparable from their own political convictions 
I just wanted to offer a personal statement of how this NAME member at least felt about the letter to the NAME since the issue of what members thought has been raised by Professor NAME 
Best regards NAME NAME 
You are here NAME NAME NAME position on NAME boycott NAME position on NAME boycott NAME has made its position opposing the boycott of NAME academics very clear in the following NUM statements issued in July NUM 
First statement CHAR NAME academic serves on the Board of the Journal of Translational Studies 
But the Journal is not a NAME publication nor is it run by an organisation based at NAME 
The Journal is entirely separate and independent 
The decision taken by the Journal on this particular matter does not reflect NAME policy in any way 
NAME regrets the action taken to remove NUM NAME academics from the Board 
NAME is a multicultural and multinational community that believes strongly that discrimination based on nationality race religion or other grounds is wrong 
NAME statement NAME is holding an inquiry into the issues arising from Professor NAME s decision to remove NUM NAME academics from the Boards of her independently owned journals 
NAME has always had a clear position on this issue we strongly believe that discrimination is unacceptable that the NAME academics should not have been removed and that this decision was wrong 
If the academics had been working on NAME journals rather than independent and privately owned journals they would never have been removed 
However they are not NAME journals and do not carry the NAME logo 
NAME appreciates the controversy and great upset that this issue has caused to many people including our own students and staff 
NAME is holding an internal inquiry into this matter which will cover all relevant issues 
The inquiry will be wideranging dealing thoroughly and sensitively with all the issues that have arisen as a result of this case 
The inquiry will be conducted according to NAME s procedures and will determine any further necessary action

NAME NAME on CorpusBased Approaches to Figurative Language 
Thursday th March NUM all day WEBSITE 
as part of 
CORPUS LINGUISTICS NUM 
main programme th March st April NUM NAME University NAME WEBSITE 
NAME 
Figurative language is pervasive in all kinds of discourse and as a phenomenon has attracted considerable interest from a wide variety of fields including linguistics psychology artificial intelligence and philosophy 
However the majority of work has been guided by linguistic intuition and not analysis of real usage 
We intend this workshop to address this by focussing on the use of corpora to investigate figurative language 
The following areas are of particular interest 
corpusbased studies of figurative aspects of any language 
corpusbased studies of polysemy and contextsensitive meaning in their relation to figurative language 
multilingual or crosslingual studies of figurative language 
computational models of figurative language interpretation or generation using results from corpora for guidance or being substantially evaluated on corpora 
psychological models of figurative language processing using results from corpora as a significant contribution 
relationships between processing models and corpus studies 
A second intention of the workshop will be to explore the methodological issues of using corpora to study figurative language 
Issues include 
illumination of the concepts of literalness metaphor metonymy etc through corpus studies 
interannotator agreement on what constitutes figurative language metaphor metonymy etc 
specific linguistic cues for figurative language including studies of their frequencies and reliability and evaluation of their amenability to automated detection 
corpus design and corpus analysis tools for figurative language studies 
effects of domain genre or corpus type on studies of figurative language including crosscorpus studies 
The workshop is intended to be a followup to our previous workshop at Corpus Linguistics NUM 
The previous workshop was well attended with NUM presented papers NUM discussion sessions and about NUM participants 
Selected papers will also appear in an issue of Metaphor and Symbol journal 
The time for a second workshop is appropriate since in the last NUM years there has been a great deal of interest and new research in this area 
We intend the workshop to fill a full day with NUM NUM presented papers 
A proceedings of full papers will be generated from the workshop and we will also explore the possibility of publishing selected papers in a relevant journal 
Submissions 
Anybody wishing to present at the workshop should submit a twopage abstract

WEBSITE 
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers working on problems related to the creation and use of parallel text 
Recent events have demonstrated once again the importance of interlanguage communication and reinforce the need for advances in machine translation MT and multilingual processing tools 
The workshop will be centered around the problem of building and using parallel corpora which are vital resources for efficiently deriving multilingual text processing tools 
In addition to regular papers the workshop also includes a shared task that will result in a comparative evaluation of word alignment techniques 
We invite submissions of papers addressing any of the following issues 
Construction of parallel corpora including the automatic identification and harvesting of parallel corpora from the Web 
Methods to evaluate the quality of parallel corpora and word alignments 
Tools for processing parallel corpora including automatic sentence alignment word alignment phrase alignment detection of omissions and gaps in translations and others 
Using parallel corpora for data driven NAME Translation 
Using parallel corpora for the derivation of language processing tools in new languages 
Using parallel corpora for automatic corpora NAME 
Language learning applied to parallel corpora 
Translation memory systems as a source of aligned corpora 
While we invite submissions addressing any of the above topics or related issues we particularly welcome work involving parallel corpora addressing languages with scarce resources 
We expect to make arrangements with a journal in Natural Language Processing or Computational Linguistics for a special issue that will include selected papers from this workshop 
Invited Speaker 
NAME NAME University of Montreal 
Shared NAME 
All researchers who have a word alignment system available are invited to participate in the shared task individually or as part of a team 
Participants in the shared task will be provided with common sets of training data consisting of RomanianEnglish and FrenchEnglish parallel texts 
Participants will be given approximately NUM month to train their systems with this data and then previously held out test data will be released 
Participants will run their alignment system on this test data and submit their results which will be evaluated using a common set of metrics 
See the workshop website for details regarding the shared task 
Submission format 
Submissions should consist of regular full papers of max 
NUM pages formatted following the NAME NUM guidelines 
In addition teams participating in the word alignment shared task are invited to submit short papers max

Re parser output on our metonymy data
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Hi 
thanks a lot for looking at the data 
NUM Sorry for misleading you about tokenisation we did leave upper cases in when we parsed what we sent you was a file produced afterwards that included samplenumbers so that the examples can be tracked and was lower cased after parsing and which we used for extraction of the roles but the sentences submitted to the parser had the upper case preserved 
I realise now that this was the wrong thing to do and that I forgot to mention this 
however the mistakes that you attributed to tokenisation are now all tagging mistakes so that your tagging comments now probably hold for these examples 
Thus eg the NAME islands case has the followign tokenisation and then the tagger for whatever reason removes the upper case for Islands 
ABSTRACT id SENTENCE WThe NUM WSolomon NUM WIslands NUM Wis NUM Wa NUM Wnew NUM Wnationstate NUM Wwhich NUM Wmay NUM Whave NUM NUM NUM Wcreated NUM Wthrough NUM Wthe NUM Wimposition NUM Wof NUM Wan NUM Warbitrary NUM Wboundary NUM W NUM Wbut NUM Whas NUM Wto NUM Wexist NUM Was NUM Wa NUM Wviable NUM Winstitution NUM Wwithin NUM Wthe NUM Wmodern NUM Wworld NUM CHAR NUM NUM ABSTRACT 
Tagger output and parser input 
NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME nationstateNN NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME toTO NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME 
We also see islands as the head thus if islands would have been parsed as subject we are happy and see the whole country name as a subject role and the parse as correct 
Instead of multiword tokenisation we have such a mapping in the role extraction module so we are ok on that 
The same holds for the other tokenisation cases that now are all tagging problems eg the NAME NAME example normally the tagger gets this right as a proper name byut in NUM case it did nt 
NUM Thanks for the comments about the parse timeout and the tagging thresholding it looks as if this might solve a lot of our cases 
NAME weighting might be sensible too as we do mostly care about precision not recall 
In cases where grammatical functions are missed we can default to literal baselines which is a very good baseline instead if precision is low we overgenerate metonymies 
NUM NAME precision and recall for subjects and objects were only talked about precision at talk as this is more important to us at the moment 
NAME CHAR NUM recall NUM thus Fmeasure over NUM as you said 
NAME precision NUM recall NUM NAME are rounded 
Note that the datasets are very small NUM subjects and NUM objects in our dataset as most country names are pps 
Thanks again for all the help

my ng NUM NAME Ngramsnew windowsize NUM NUM 
or different types of ngrams eg 
my ng NUM NAME Ngramsnew type NUM byte my ng NUM NAME Ngramsnew type NUM word 
DESCRIPTION This module implement text ngram analysis supporting several types of analysis including character and word ngrams 
The module Text NAME is very flexible 
For example it allows a user to manually feed a sequence of any tokens 
It handles several types of tokens character word and also allows a lot of flexibility in automatic recognition and feed of tokens and the way they are combined in an CHAR NAME 
It counts all ngram frequencies up to the maximal specified length 
The output format is meant to be pretty much humanreadable while also loadable by the module 
The module can be used from the command line through the script the ngramspl manpage provided with the package

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS If a user customizes a type it is possible that a resultpound CHAR ing ngram will be ambiguous 
In this way to different ngrams may be counted as one 
With predefined types of ngrams this should not happen 
For example if a user chooses that a token can contain a space and uses space as an ngram separator then a tripound CHAR NAME like this CHAR CHAR CHAR CHAR is ambiguous

Thanks for your replies 
A question now if you allow me 
In a very large number of cases I see that the tokenizer has returned words for which the lemma is ended by a backslash among others when the words are in capitals in a title 
Is that something that comes from the original data or is it a meaningful indication of some linguistic feature about that word 
In other words can I safely delete any trailing in lemmas 
Another question related 
In a first attempt at creating a database I modified all lemmas to have them lowercase so as to avoid having duplicate lemmas 
However I ve started thinking that the case information is important for proper names and so on 
NAME among all the cases of capital letters there are NUM types meaningful cases proper nouns with leading capital acronyms with more than NUM capital or only capital letters and the meaningless NUM as far as semantics is concerned Initial word in a sentence with leading capital titles and other highlighted words with only capital letters 
When the first type is interesting to have in the NAME the second is not 
Unfortunately it is impossible to distinguish the cases 
What do you think is best then 
NAME all information or keeping all cases as in the original data 
Thanks in advance

NAME NUM Postconference NAME NAME Convention Center NAME NAME July NUM NUM 
Workshop on Multilingual NAME and Question Answering NAME NAME and Beyond 
NAME Speakers NUM NAME NAME Library Information Research National Institute of Informatics NAME NAME NUM NAME NAME Dept of Computer Sciences NAME of NAME at NAME NAME 
Automatic summarization and question answering aim at producing a concise condensed representation of the key information content in an information source for a particular user and task 
Interest in automatic summarization and question answering continues to grow motivated by the explosion of online information sources and advances in natural language processing and information retrieval 
In fact various forms of automatic summarization 
and question answering will undoubtedly be indispensable given the massive information universes that lie ahead in the st century 
NAME and question answering involves the extraction or generation of text snippets to fulfill some user needs 
Rulebased or statisticalbased summarization and NAME systems have shown promising results in the NAME NAME tracks NAME NAME and NAME NAME it is however very difficult to find good evaluation functions or rules that work well across domains or in all questions because there are many system parameters that must be carefully tuned in order to achieve good system performance 
In consequence various machine learning ML techniques have recently been applied to summarization and NAME systems 
The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for exploring the commonality underling this diversity of problem domain and approaches 
The workshop has the following goals 
to bring together communities of researchers who apply machine learning techniques to summarization and NAME systems to deepen the summarization and NAME community s understanding of the state of the art in machine learning to identify summarization and QArelated problems for which NAME techniques might be appropriate and to advance the state of the art of summarization and NAME technologies 
Topics appropriate to this workshop include 
summarization or NAME systems with NAME techniques novel or improved NAME techniques for summarization or NAME effective feature extraction methods for characterizing summarization or NAME metrics and benchmarks for evaluating the effect of machine learning techniques in summarization or NAME systems generation for summarization or NAME crosslanguage or multilingual NAME integration with Web and NAME access corpora creation for summarization or NAME interfaces and tools for summarization or NAME

We describe an evolutionbased method for evaluating auction mechanisms and apply it to a space of mechanisms including the standard first and secondprice sealed bid auctions 
We replicate results known already in the Auction Theory literature regarding the suitability of different mechanisms for different bidder environments and extend the literature by establishing the superiority of novel mechanisms over standard mechanisms for commonly occurring scenarios 
Thus we simultaneously extend NAME Theory and provide a systematic method for further such extensions

letter from past presidents
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Dear colleagues I do not know the history of corporate involvement by the NAME in public issues of language use and language politics further back than NUM 
However I agree with NAME NAME and NAME NAME in regretting the public position taken by some of the past presidents of NAME on the matter of NAME s boycott or rather in regretting the manner of taking it 
I do nt think it matters that my dues are not currently paid up as it is clearly the general intention of the NAME to represent NAME in NAME 
I would be very surprised if members of the mass media did not take the letter in question as NAME facto representing majority opinion in the linguistics community no matter how carefully the authors qualify their undoubtedly honourable intentions since such qualifications are exactly the sort of thing that gets overlooked by nonacademics in general and the media in particular 
In that respect I very much appreciated April NAME s stance in refusing to endorse the letter without formal support from the membership 
It s not clear to me from reading the past presidents letter why they felt it necessary to go forward without securing such support or perhaps discovering its absence 
The NAME affair has been reported for some months now and the letter does not appear to highlight any radically new or timesensitive developments 
It s also not clear to me what committee April s letter refers to some of this may be down to my ignorance of developments at the last meeting 
I am however familiar with the participation of the Linguistic Society of NAME in matters of public interest concerning language over the last NUM years 
While the NAME has not always been effective or unproblematic in its approach it has generally sought member approval in an organised fashion for statements and resolutions sometimes as in the NAME case within a few weeks after significant events occurred 
More importantly in recent years it has voiced corporate opinion primarily on issues in which NAME are significantly united and which fall under our professional remit such as the harmful misconceptions underlying the EnglishOnly movement NUM the protection of basic language rights NUM the systematicity of African American English and the pedagogical soundness of the NAME school system s approach in the Ebonics controversy NUM the academic effectiveness of bilingual education NUM and the adequacy of signed languages NUM 
See webpage at WEBSITE these cases the burden for summarising research and drafting a statement for presentation to the membership has indeed fallen on NUM individual as in the contrasting case NAME describes but it is then handled through the Committee on Social and Political Concerns in a regular way 
Perhaps some such more elaborated structure might be useful for NAME in view of the concerns that members have voiced 
The issues of academic freedom raised in the past presidents letter are indeed important NUM for all academics but I cannot see that there is anything linguistic about them other than the content of the journal in question which has not surfaced as an issue in any of the reports I have seen 
It thus seems fair to clarify why NAME should collectively address this issue and similar NUM which may arise in future and how this can best be done

the nightmare continues 
I ve been hacking around with the exclusion list feature and I ve come up with the following 
Do nt know whether you know this stuff already NAME but if you do nt it might save you some time 
The tagger exclusion list 
must use the CHAR flag after CHAR and before CHAR CHAR I think when invoking 
exclusion list MUST be in the same format as the lexicon ie NAME NAME CHAR tag CHAR 
where CHAR is the number of words in the exclusion list 
This is of course rather silly because the tags are totally redundant as far as I can see 
the excluded words ARE NOT output along with the other tags rather just the symbol is output making the whole thing somewhat pointless for my purposes 
Anything you know about this that I do nt I m all ears

if argv 
NUM then NAME Usage scr dirsfile file extension to apply to ie man exit NUM endif 
set ext NUM set dirs cat NUM perl CHAR CHAR s CHAR ext CHAR 
where the NUM and ext are script variables 
The problem is of course that ext gets interpretted as a perl variable I assume because it is within single quotes and therefore untouched by the shell script interpretter 
I want a method of forcing ext to be expanded by the shell before it gets passed to perl

Hi everybody 
Nearly NUM weeks ago I posted the following query to this list 
For a current project involving collocations a colleague and I need to compute several hundreds of FE tests some of which involve very high marginal totals even though the cooccurrence frequencies are very small 
The question now is do you happen to know of any NAME NAME NAME software that can cope with the enormous sizes of the resulting figures 
An example NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM 
Some scripts on the web seemed to do the job but on second looks the results seemd wrong because transforming tables along the main diagonal with such high figures lead to different results inviting the inference that the scripts only computed approximations Any idea CHAR 
I thank the following people for their advice NAME NAME who suggested programming the test in NAME or MAPLE NAME NAME NAME who directed me to versions of NAME like Allegro common lisp I believe but NOT the lisp used to implement the NAME editor which can handle integers with large infinite numbers of digits NAME NAME who proposed the Scheme programming language see WEBSITE NAME EMAIL who suggested to use NAME 
In the meantime I have also myself also come across CHAR see WEBSITE and also seems capable of handling the extremely large numbers mentioned above

NAME NAME wrote 
Hi NAME Embarrassingly for someone who works in text classification I m finding myself losing the battle against spam 
WEBSITE which has NAME installed and that works great 
I have it set up to insert a tag in my subject line and have an ORG rule that sorts all mail with that tag into a folder 
I scan through the subject lines in that folder at erratic intervals and rescue any false positives 
Unfortunately most of my mail comes through NAME NAME 
NAME provides Brightmail as their option for spam filtering but does not have an option to insert a tag in the subject line 
Instead your only option is to have mail moved to a folder on NAME s server from which it is deleted at shorter intervals than I would remember to check in on it 
So I m not willing to use that option 
I ve written Outlook NAME rules which capture some spam but find it tedious to keep them up to date 
So I ve started to research clientbased antispam products and thought it would be fun to hear what folks on this list are using 
Since this topic could pretty easily lead into details that are only borderline relevant for DDLBETA I d prefer you send your response directly to me and I will summarize responses to the list

On Tuesday st April NAME NAME will be talking at NAME on his work NAME CHAR NAME for Life Drawing 
Most work with artproducing computers has focussed on imaginative images often underwritten by data about the appearance of things in the real world 
I am concerned here with considering objective drawing exemplified by life drawing in which the physical subject is explicit and problems revolve around the making of marks to stand for that subject 
As a basis for consideration of such issues I ll describe early work on NAME a paper model of a computerbased machine for life drawing 
NAME derives data from the scene before her and makes goaldirected marks to represent what is seen 
NAME effectively serves as a testbed for understanding of the processes at work in human drawing 
Also implicit in such a project are ubiquitous questions about computer creativity and machine aesthetics 
As the project is at a formative stage I will be particularly interested in feedback from the NAME members 
More information about NAME NAME can be found at WEBSITE

We will have some time then to decide on the order of the questions compare questions and change for the professors into gowns 
By the way you may want to hint about your questions to NAME directly this is rather common but not obligatory 
Given that there is nt a lot of time I would propose to meet there a bit earlier eg between NUM and NUM 
NUM NUM sharp the ceremony starts everybody will have some time for questions 
NUM NUM sharp question time is over and the committee retreats to decide whether NAME has done a good job and sign the diploma 
Then we return announce the degree there is a short laudatio and then a reception outside the NAME 
Perhaps we could have lunch together afterwards 
NAME has a list of hotels you could use to book a room if you are coming the day before NAME already booked and I assume NAME will too 
I have to be in NAME the th so wo nt be in NAME until the day of the promotion but I am available on Friday afternoon and evening if anyone is still around 
NAME and or NAME may be available Thursday evening as well 
Let me or NAME know if you need assistance in arranging things

NAME MEAD multidocument summarization environment
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
MEAD NAME released 
WEBSITE 
NAME is a multidocument summarization system with multilingual capabilities 
The NAME system implements extractive summarization whereby summaries are produced by selecting a subset of highly relevant sentences from the cluster s overall set of sentences 
NAME can summarize clusters of English documents on most POSIXconforming operating systems and can summarize clusters of NAME Chinese documents on a subset of these operating systems 
The NAME system has been under development since NUM 
Versions NUM and NUM were developed at the University of NAME 
Version NUM was developed at a sixweek workshop at the NAME NAME University 
Versions NUM through NUM were incremental improvements by the NAME workshop team members 
With version NUM development of NAME has moved back to the University of NAME 
MEAD NUM represents a major refactoring of previous NAME versions 
The current version supports all the functionality of previous versions but also has many new features 
Some of these are 
Version NUM is much more configurable than previous versions of NAME 
It allows for both systemwide and userspecific configuration files 
It has a simplified user interface 
Previous versions required the user to manually edit a meadconfig file and use a combination of NAME shell commands to produce summaries 
While the current version still supports this interface MEAD NUM has a single script interface that essentially eliminates the need for manual editing of meadconfig files 
NAME NAME a previously freestanding tool for evaluating summarizers has been incorporated with the current version of NAME 
This allows users to evaluate existing summaizers as well as evaluate the performance of the base MEAD system and any user modifications 
MEAD NAME supports coselection percent agreement precision recall NAME and contentbased evaluation metrics such as word overlap and longest common subsequence as well as relative utility 
NAME uses an extensive collection of custom NAME modules that may be suitable for use in many natural language applications including for example question answering 
NAME and leadbased summarizers have been incorporated into the NAME framework 
These summarizers provide useful examples of how to create new NAME modules 
The documentation for the current version has been expanded and now includes a significant number of example use cases and tutorials for customizing each of NAME s modules

NAME Corpus Sanitation

Dear All 
I was interested to read in the recent posting to the list by NAME NAME see below that he was uncertain as to whether he should make his corpus publicly available because it contained some uncensored words NAME s point NUM 
I guess that this means bad language I assume it does not relate to anonymization issues as they are covered in NAME s point NUM If this is about bleeping out words in corpora should nt we encourage NAME not to do this 
Surely we want corpora to contain uncensored speech 
The point for me of using corpora is to describe account for language as it is rather than language as we wish it to be

NAME 
Dear all 
I got several responses asking if I am planning to make my question list public 
I think I should answer this question to the whole list 
I am willing to make it public but I am not sure if I should do it right now 
Here are the reasons 
NUM Some questions ask information about specific people not only celebrities but also probably the questioners or other people with very close relationships to the questioners 
This may raise some privacy issues 
I prefer to take off these questions before make the question corpus public 
NUM Some questions actually not a small number contain some uncensored words 
I think these questions are improper to be in a corpus 
NUM Many questions are not grammatically correct or with some spell errors 
I personally think this is ok becaues the questions are from real world 
I do nt know what other researchers think about this 
NUM Different researchers may have different expections 
For example the original poster of this thread required why and how questions other people have asked about statistic information on specific phrase groups 
I would like to know if there are some common requirements from most or many researchers 
NUM After I do something to the question archive and make it public I am thinking of updating the public question corpus time to time 
More efforts have to take and I am not sure if I have enough energy to do this 
I hope some NUM is willing to join me 
I am waiting for your inputs 
Especially if you are willing to do something for building the corpus I am happy to work with you 
Many thanks

word simplification project for NAME NAME
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Here s the tentative idea I ve got comments would be very welcome 
NAME 
NUM use CIDE or NAME as a resource learner s dictionaries so some guarantee that we ll get good words in the defns unlike NAME 
NUM concentrate on monosemous verbs 
Rationale do nt want to do NAME should be enough to be interesting for an expt monosemous verbs tend to be the less frequent NUM hence NUM we want to simplify 
A future project could do NAME if this works 
NUM Analyse the CIDE NAME definitions for the target verbs to find the candidate substitutable terms 
I am not sure whether this will be too difficult or not 
The idea would be that if you had a definition like CIDE s 
extinguish to stop a fire or light burning 
you d want to get something like 
stop NAME burning 
it might be necessary to handle disjunctions as alternatives 
extirpate to remove or destroy something completely 
remove NAME completely destroy NAME completely 
My guess is that there are a reasonable number of cases where this is nt too hard especially if you wrote patterns that depended on verb class possibly something close has been done already 
NUM NAME parse the input text so that the substitution could be made ignoring it if it there is nt a clear match 
eg the rain extinguished the fire NAME extinguish fire etc 
the rain stopped the fire burning 
NUM OPTIONAL check the substitution or choose between substitutions by seeing whether the grammatical relations corresponded to things that you d already seen 
eg stop the fire burning you d be looking to see whether NAME stop fire occurred elsewhere in some large corpus NAME using NAME s database maybe

Re NAME NAME NAME guidelines
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
On NAME NAME NUM NUM at NUM NUM AM NUM NAME NAME wrote 
Dear NAME NAME 
We are in the process of converting our corpus of transcribed academic speech from NAME to NAME and adding additional NAME 
Can anyone point us to some standards or preferably precedents for NAME NAME of 
NUM NAME tagging and NUM pragmatic markup eg text segments manually identified as narrative disagreement request etc 
Within the NAME guidelines P we ve found some suggestions for the NAME tagging but nothing yet for something like our pragmatic categories eg 
s typesentence CHAR ana at The w CHAR ana nn victim w CHAR ana gen s m CHAR ana nn friends w s 
But somehow this seems a bit more verbose than it needs to be 
Is this format standard or are there other XMLstyle NAME formats in use 
NUM Yes 
It is standard 
Why is verbosity a problem 
If you want a compact format you might choose to define your own 
But if you do that it is a good idea to also define a systematic and information preserving automatic mapping from your compact format to a specific NAME format and back 
That way you get the benefit of NAME s tools for transformation and validation as well as whatever other benefits you obtain from working with your compact format 
NUM You may want to look at the choices made in partofspeech tagging the British National Corpus 
NUM thing I noticed in your format is that applying a tool like NAME s textonly to it would yield either 
Thevictimsfriends 
or 
The victim s friends 
with the difference arising from the choice of whether to intepret the newlines after the w tags as part of the document or not 
If you care about document layout you may need to do something rather more complex 
The NAME has a plausible solution to this problem they include whitespace in the CHAR NUM elements but this complicates the problem of counting words 
Whether that matters to you depends I suppose on what kinds of document you want to represent and why

Re NAME NAME NAME NAME
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
NAME 
this certainly solves NUM problem which has been troubling me unfortunatley at the expense of creating another problem 
What you propose seems to be a fitting end to the book and sounds very good 
So thank you very much for that I imagine it will be much less controversial than the suggestion NAME and I made some time ago 
Could you suggest a title 
The problem it creates of course is with the PAST section 
First NAME has never confirmed he is willing to produce the NAME chapter 
NAME 
Secondly I too think Synonymy and Semantic Classification is an under rated work and I believe can be read with profit by modern students whatever its shortcomings 
Further I think it underpins all the subsequent work in important ways 
Therefore I feel the volume would be diminished and be less of a piece without this section 
Can I suggest NUM ways we might move this forward presuming you do nt have the time to do both Chapters 
NUM we ie you and I consider collaborating to produce a chapter along the original lines together NUM we try to find someone else to provide a chapter along the originally proposed lines of course its going to be difficult to find someone who knows the narrow field and the NAME background 
What do you think 
NAME 
NAME I would like to argue for moving my category in the NAME NAME and see if you agree 
Im down to reexamine her PhD thesis Synonymy and Semantic Classification and I did indeed volunteer for that as think it s an underrated work and indeed got her to publish it NUM years after she wrote it in a book series I then ran 
However I now think that s a bit limited and would like to offer something possible in your empty FUTURES section on the opposition running right through her work and indeed through the fields she spanned NAME and NAME on whether NAME methods are needed in NAME or not or vice versa or not 
As many of you know she wrote an article a couple of years ago in NAME arguing NO and YES respectively 
The answer is quite important for both fields and I d like to address it arguing PROBABLY YES and PROBABLY NO while in the course of it touching on and reviving her thesis work as I had originally intended 
If you agree that will leave NAME in solitary state in the PAST section but everything will then be minimally populated 
Let me know NAME NAME

Dear NAME 
NAME NAME and I are writing a grant proposal on the semantics of punctuation 
It s a new area for me and I m not familiar with the literature 
NAME tells me that you have a huge folder of stuff on this subject 
I would be grateful if you could give me some recommendations of what to read especially of papers and or dissertations that I can access online 
I know about NAME Say s NAME thesis but have been unable to access it online and so I ve emailed her 
I ve also downloaded all the papers from your NUM workshop but these papers are quite short and I was hoping for papers that give more detail if there are any 
A quick check on citeseer really threw up only the stuff from your workshop 
But I ca nt help thinking that there is more stuff out there such as NAME dissertations 
Basically I want to avoid reinventing the wheel and although NAME is up on the stuff in NAME he does nt know very much about what s going on formal semantic analyses of punctuation if there is anything 
I ve been thinking about the data a bit now and it s fanscinating 
It s all there parantheses as presupposition triggers weird anaphoric effects rhetorical structure constraints on the properties of the intended addressee etc etc And then I have 
no idea how to deal with the semantic typing issues in something like the quotation contexts of 
NAME said I have a very large something I m too embarrassed to say what 
It should be fun to work on this stuff but I need to know what s already been done first 
I would be grateful for any advice on what to read

NAME 
For more than half a century people have tried to engineer software evolutionary systems which are capable of ongoing innovation and the evolution of complex agents 
These attempts have met with limited success 
In this talk I will briefly review some of the seminal examples of this endeavour including NAME NAME s selfreproducing automata NAME s platform of selfreproducing computer programs NAME and NAME evolved virtual creatures and identify aspects of each system that inhibit evolvability 
This will lead onto a discussion of how to design an improved evolutionary system that could overcome some of these problems and exhibit improved evolvability

NAME NAME 
I ve started analysing what NAME gets wrong and since it gets plenty wrong it s taking a while to work through it all but here are my notes on the sort of things I m finding 
If you have any input on this that d be great 
I d probably find a meeting to discuss these baseline results helpful quite soon 
I ll try to come up with a clearer picture of where and why errors occur in what sort of proportions by then 
Thanks

BC NAME TYPE LOCATION PEARLHARBOR ENAMEXHNS

NAME interprets whole thing as NUM word which is not in the lexcison so best NAME can do is say it s all NUM proper noun which then gets tagged as name PERSON 
NAME TYPEDATE NUM 
NUM 
NAME NAME NAME only recognises this format as a num not date 
T NUM Tph np NP num NAME 
NAME TYPE LOCATION PEARL HARBOR NUM 
PEARL HARBOR 
Untagged

in lexicon 
harbored NUM NAME NUM harbors NUM NN NUM harbour NUM NN NUM VV NUM harbouring NUM NAME NUM harbours NUM NN NUM 
Harbour NUM NNL NUM Harbor NUM NNL NUM 
ie NAME does nt recognise HARBOR as a locative noun since it treats the capitlaised word as being all lowercase

Tph pp PP p P pn For NAME N npp N CHAR use NAME PP p P pnp by NAME NP nplu N nnamen NAME NAME N nnamen NAME NAME N nnamen NAME NAME N nn News NAME N nn Service NAME N CHAR clients NAME NUM 
NUM example where NAME gets the bracketing wrong 
However even if the bracketing was right the only entry for Service in the lexicon is 
Service NUM NN NUM 
ie it will never get tagged as a NAME org so nothing would be tagged as an ORGANIZATION 
NAME TYPE PERSON CHARLES NAME NAME NUM 
NAME TYPE PERSON CHARLES NUM NAME TYPE PERSON J NUM NAME TYPE PERSON LEWIS NUM 
Again the bracketing is all wrong so we get NUM single cases of name 
PERSON instead of one 
c NAME TYPEDATE NUM 
c NUM 
Untagged because the tokeniser has nt split the year into its own word 
N nn NAME NAME N nnamen Hearst NAME N CHAR Newspapers NAME 
NAME TYPE ORGANIZATION Hearst Newspapers NUM 
NAME TYPE PERSON Hearst NUM NAME 
newspaper NUM NN NUM newspaper s NUM NN NUM newspaperpackets NUM NN NUM newspapermen NUM NN NUM newspapers NUM NN NUM 
No lexicon entry for Newspaper inclusing as a NAME otherwise presumably the whole N would be tagged org ORGANIZATION 
NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME NUM NAME The NAME TYPE ORGANIZATION NAME NUM has denied a request that top NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME NUM commanders in NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME NUM in NAME TYPEDATE NUM be absolved of blame for failing to be on alert for the Japanese attack on NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME Harbor NUM but the military agreed that top NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME NUM officials also must share the blame 
All of these are untagged since NAME ca nt come up with a parse tree not even a CHAR fragx for this sentence 
NAME TYPE ORGANIZATION NAME NUM 
Untagged since lexcison entry is 
NAME NUM NN NUM NP NUM 
ie never a NAME 
Rear Admiral NAME NAME TYPE PERSON E 
NAME NUM 
Rear Admiral NAME TYPE PERSON Husband NAME NAME NUM 
So close 
Lexicon entries 
Admiral NUM NNSB NUM Admirals NUM NNSB NUM NAME NUM NP NUM RearAdmiral NUM NNSB NUM ViceAdmiral NUM NNSB NUM 
NAME NUM NP NUM NAME NUM NP NUM 
NP NUM both NAME N CHAR Rear NAME NP npnpcoord NP npretitnname Admiral NAME N nnamenname Husband NAME N nnamenname E NAME N CHAR Kimmel NAME 
ie since NAME is nt cannot be interpreted as a NAME it is bracketed with the name N not the title and tagged as a name PERSON 
his NAME TYPE ORGANIZATION Army NUM counterpart NAME 
Gen 
NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NAME NAME NUM 
his NAME TYPE ORGANIZATION Army NUM counterpart NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NUM 
Gen 
NAME TYPE PERSON NAME CHAR NAME NUM 
NAME tokenisation so NAME treats as NUM sentences 
NP nppcocj NP detn his APP N norgn Army NAME N CHAR counterpart NAME NAME NP nnname N CHAR NAME NAME 
followed by 
T NUM Tph n N CHAR Gen NAME 
and 
NP nnname N nnamenname NAME NAME N nnamenname C NAME N CHAR NAME NAME 
However NAME is tagged as a NP since no lexicon for the abbreviation for NAME NAME NUM NNS NUM NNSB NUM NP NUM MajorGeneral NUM NNSB NUM NAME NUM NP NUM NAME NUM NP NUM SergeantMajor NUM NNSB NUM 
Otherwise NAME does okay bracketing and tagging both Army and NAME NAME NAME correctly 
leading up to the NAME TYPEDATE NAME 
NUM NUM NUM debacle 
leading up to the NAME TYPE TIME NAME 
NUM NUM NUM debacle 
The bracketing is slightly wrong here only NAME of punctuation 
N CHAR N nntn N nntnpnum NAME NAME NP num T nlmtar NAME NAME Taph CHAR NUM Tph np NP num NAME NAME NUM debacle NAME 
Why is the comma included as part of the N 
Also NAME tags it as a TIME not DATE since it recognises Dec as a month so classifies it as a temporal expression but has nt applied its date rule 
NAME NAME date N NAME TEMP N NAME NAME H 
Why not 
NAME applies it here 
P pnpntOn NAME NP date January NAME NP num NAME NAME 
which is also a NAME followed by a NP num 
NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME NUM 
NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NUM 
Perfect bracketing but NAME is not in the lexicon as a NNL so NAME guesses name PERSON 
NAME NUM NP NUM NAME NUM NP NUM 
in the direction of NAME TYPE PERSON Kimmel ENAMEXs and NAME TYPE PERSON NAME ENAMEXs advocates by criticizing top NAME TYPE ORGANIZATION Na vy NUM and NAME TYPE ORGANIZATION Army NUM officials in NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME NUM for being neither energetic nor effective in getting warnings to NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME NUM about alarming intelligence reports that CHAR NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME ENAMEXJapanese rupture was just hours away 
in the direction of NAME TYPE PERSON NAME s and NAME s advocates by criticizing top Navy and Army officials in NAME for being neither energetic nor effective in getting warnings to NAME about alarming intelligence reports that a NAME Japanese rupture was just hours away NUM 
The bracketing is way off here 
P pnpname of NAME NP npnpcoord NP npnpossellipr NP nnname N CHAR Kimmel NAME CHAR NUM SMILEY NP cjendnp and NAME NP nppossn NP npnposs NP nnname N CHAR NAME NAME CHAR NUM SMILEY N npp N CHAR advocates NAME PP p P ping by NAME V vppp V vppp V vn criticizeing NAME N nncoord N CHAR top NAME N nncoord N CHAR Navy NAME N cjendn and NAME N norgn Army NAME N CHAR officials NAME PP p P pnpname in NAME NP nnname N CHAR NAME NAME PP p P ping for NAME V vppp V beap being NAME AP apapcoord AP a A adva AP a A a neither NAME A a energetic NAME AP cjendap nor NAME AP a A a effective NAME 
etc 
so NAME misses tagging other potential entities eg it would have correctly tagged Army as ORGANIZATION 
But it would have missed tagging Navy likewise dewspite it s being tagged NAME 
Why does the org tag not appear here 
N nncoord N CHAR Navy NAME 
NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME Harbor NUM

Untagged but I think this is a slightly dodgy classification by the annotators 
absolve Admiral NAME TYPE PERSON Kimmel NUM and General NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NUM of accountability 
absolve NAME TYPE PERSON Admiral NAME NUM and NAME TYPE PERSON General NAME of accountability NUM 
The bracketing s wrong again 
V vnpname absolve NAME NP npretitnname Admiral NAME N CHAR Kimmel NAME 
NAME correctly identifies Admiral as a title part of a name but then classifies the whole thing as a name PERSON rather than just the following name 
This is more a reflection on my choise of mapping to NAME classifications though 
On the other hand NAME definitely should nt have bracketed of accountability together with the rest of the name and has mistagged General as an adjective presumably because also of the incorrect bracketing 
NP nnname N apn AP a A a General NAME N nppof NAME NAME PP p P pn of NAME N CHAR accountability NAME 
General NUM NAME NUM NNS NUM NNSB NUM 
the NAME report said 
the NAME TYPE PERSON Dorn NUM report said 
Here NAME has tagged CHAR the part of report named after a person as a PERSON 
Again I think this is a bit of a grey area especially since 
the NAME TYPE PERSON Kimmel NUM family 
is counted as a PERSON which NAME also tags 
the NAME TYPE PERSON Kimmel NUM family 
chairman of the NAME TYPE ORGANIZATION NAME Armed Services Committee NUM 
chairman of NAME TYPE PERSON the NAME NUM NAME TYPE ORGANIZATION Armed Services Committee NUM 
Incorrect bracketing 
P pnpname of NAME NP detn the NAME N CHAR NAME NAME N nnorg N apn AP a A a Armed NAME N CHAR Services NAME Committee NAME 
But since Committee is tagged NAME if the bracketing was correct the classification would have been correct 
of NAME TYPEDATE last year TIMEXs 
of NAME TYPE TIME last year TIMEXs 
Perfect bracketing despite punctuation 
But again the date rule has nt been applied 
NAME TYPEDATE th anniversary of the end of NAME War NUM NUM 
th anniversary of the end of NAME War NUM 
Untagged 
The lexicon entry for anniversary is 
anniversary NUM NN NUM 
So no part of the fragment is classified as any sort of temporal expression 
NAME TYPE PERSON Kimmel NUM and NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NUM 
NAME TYPE PERSON Kimmel and NAME NUM 
Incorrect bracketing 
NP nnname N nncoord N CHAR Kimmel NAME N cjendn and NAME N CHAR NAME NAME 
NAME TYPEDATE early in NUM NUM 
early in NUM 
NAME misses this date altogether since there is no temporal noun around so just tags it as a num 
P pnpnum in NAME NP num NAME NAME 
NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NAME NAME NUM NUM of Admiral NAME TYPE PERSON NAME ENAMEXs NUM surviving sons and a leader of the campaign to exonerate his father said the NAME report confirms the assertions of the NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NUM and NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NUM families that the responsibility should be broadly shared and not placed on the shoulders of NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NUM and NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NUM exclusively

The bracketing is totally wrong for the last part of the sentence 
P pnpname of NAME NP detn the NAME N nncoord N CHAR NAME NAME N cjendn and NAME N nnamen NAME NAME N ns NAME NAME S comp that NAME S npvp NP detn the NAME N CHAR responsibility NAME V vpvpcoordr V modalbse should NAME V beppart be NAME AP a A a broadly NAME V CHAR shareed NAME V cjendvp and NAME V vpadvp V vppp V notvp not NAME V CHAR placeed NAME PP p P pnp on NAME NP detn the NAME N nppof shoulders NAME PP p P pnpname of NAME NP nnname N nncoord N CHAR NAME NAME N cjendn and NAME N CHAR NAME NAME AP a A a exclusively NAME

Incorrect bracketing again 
N norgn N nncoord Navy NAME N cjendn and NAME Army NAME N CHAR officials NAME

in NAME TYPE PERSON NAME and Southeast NUM NAME TYPE PERSON NAME NUM 
Incorrect bracketing 
NP nnname N nncoord N CHAR NAME NAME N cjendn and NAME N CHAR Southeast NAME NP nnname N CHAR NAME NAME 
NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME NUM and the freezing of Japanese assets in the NAME TYPEDATE summer of NUM NUM 
NAME TYPE PERSON NAME and the freezing of Japanese assets in the summer of NUM NUM

NAME has nt been tagged as NAME although it s in the lexicon entry 
summer NUM NN NUM NNT NUM 
so the temporal expression would nt have been picked up anyway whether as a DATE or TIME 
sent NUM days before 
sent NUM NAME TYPE TIME days NUM before 
NAME has picked up that days is a temporal noun tagging it as a TIME 
However the NAME task definition does not include relative temporal expressions 
Presumnably if it did the bracketing would be wrong 
NAME TYPE LOCATION United States NUM and NAME TYPE LOCATION NAME NUM 
NAME NAME and NAME 
N apn AP a A a United NAME N CHAR States NAME N cjendn and NAME N CHAR NAME NAME 
I m not sure why NAME does nt at least pick these up as names

Re Examination of NAME NAME
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
What I heard at the meeting I went to at ORG a couple of months ago was that the main reason for this move is the problem with appeals on the my supervisor hated me grounds 
NUM of people who fail NAME now appeal across the university as a whole and this is one of the most popular complaints 
Also there s some NAME guidelines I think I have a copy somewhere and can probably find it if required 
What I said to NAME Friday at the meeting was that there were too few of us to do this and NAME the dissertations properly the response was something along the lines of well see what the board decides and take it from there 
When NAME is on sabbatical next year all language dissertations will presumably have to be marked by NAME or me and NUM marker from Engineering my feeling is that we should just say we believe this could compromise marking standards and see what happens 
I do nt think personally that the supervisor involvement question is the main issue but the difficulty of marking a researchbased thesis which is totally outside one s area of expertise I do nt feel that we should accept a situation where both markers could be largely unaware of the prior research

Hi am is fine by me actually any time is fine by me because I m free all day NAME 
On NAME NUM NUM NAME NAME wrote 
Below are the NUM context sets where pronominal anaphora resolution could in principle help 
If you can run these through the system or give me a script then I and NAME can figure out how to integrate the antecedent CHAR back into the pattern matcher so that we can assess the effect on ranking and on the ability of the system to return the right short answer from the highest matching set of NAME 
Resolving anaphora in all the context sets could also affect rankings etc elsewhere so if we could figure out how to reintegrate the results with NAME s system it wld be good to do this 
However I do nt think it is essential we do this before submitting the abstract 
NAME s going to come to the lab NAME mng to talk about this how about we all meet briefly and then decide who is going to do what by the NAME deadline

REMINDER Linguistic Society talk this Wednesday NOTE not Thursday
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
The NAME University Linguistic Society will meet on Wednesday NUM NAME NUM 
Professor NAME NAME School of Linguistics and Language University of NAME 
will talk on 
NAME and movement types abstract below 
NAME Wednesday NUM NAME pm tea served from pm NAME The NAME Library NAME College NAME Street 
Following the talk the society s officers will take the speaker out to dinner at a local restaurant members of the audience are most welcome to join us 
Membership of the society for NUM remains at NUM pounds NUM pounds for students 
If not already paid subscriptions can be brought to the meeting 
Cheques should be made payable to NAME University Linguistic Society 
AGREEMENT AND MOVEMENT TYPES 
The talk concerns certain conditions on agreement and movement in mainly 
Icelandic raising constructions 
In Icelandic a seemtype raising verb takes an optional experiencer argument assigned dative case 
The dative NAME 
is usually moved to subject position in which case the seemverb can optionally agree with the subject of the infinitival clause as in NUM 
NUM 
NAME NAME CHAR the horses to be slow Icelandic with English words Or the 
dative NAME can remain in NAME if it is indefinite as in NUM 
In that case 
the matrix verb and the embedded subject ca nt agree so the verb gets default NAME form 
The intervening dative NAME blocks agreement 
NUM There seems seem to a man the horses to be slow If the dative NAME is whmoved it still blocks agreement 
NUM To what man do you think that seems seem CHAR the horses to be slow 
A whtrace blocks agreement but an 
NPtrace does nt NUM so to speak 
This has various interesting implicatio ns for the theory of agreement and movement 
For NUM thing it presupposes that 
the whphrase moves directly to NAME without passing through NAME or 
the relevant trace NAME be a whtrace 
It is far from obvious how this can be ensured 
And why would NPtrace and whtrace be different to begin 
with 
Matters are further complicated by the fact that although the whtrace blocks agreement it does not block NPmovement across it

Re Multilingual text categorisation
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Both language modeling papers I listed mentioned a simple technique for obtaining training data using a standard search engine such as NAME ie you can simply specify the language of the document to be searched for 
NAME 
NAME NAME NAME EMAIL 
By Multilingual NAME NAME I mean the problem of automatically assigning a category to a document whatever it is the language 
The suggested approach build separate language models for the different languages supposes to have a sufficient quantity of texts in each language and for each category to be able to learn a model 
In the real life this is not always true 
NAME 
At NUM NUM NUM NUM NUM you wrote 
I suppose if you meant applying text categorization methods to a multilingual set of documents then you could just build separate language models for the different languages using the same approach as mentioned in the above papers

I would like to ask you a favour 
In your NAME paper on the NAME website you say that you found a way to call NAME from within NAME on each individual sentence using xmlperl 
I assume you set this up as a clientserver architecture so that the parser has to load the grammar only once 
Could you tell me how you did that or even send me the code

NUM thing that I think we ought to discuss before the projects are marked is the feedback that we give the students on the projects 
at the moment we do nt tell them anything which I assume is because the course is over and because technically we should nt tell them anything until it s ratified by ORG but I do nt think this is consistent with the University policy on retention of exam results since we actually keep the marks ourselves and supply markbased information in references 
the general University policy is that we should tell students everything that might provide useful feedback 
Personally I think we should give the students letter grades not necessarily immediately after the exam it could wait till ORG has OKayed them and it could be something that was only disclosed on request 
But I think this is the sort of thing that should be discussed since I do nt want to lumber any future examiners with a choice that seems unreasonable

NAME NUM Error With Editor

Dear NAME 
Re NAME NUM 
I am writing as I have noticed an error when I was compiling the NAME Status Report 
I realised that the above paper is with you for a decision following the NUM reports we have received on the paper but I have recently asked NUM more people to review 
I apologise for this mistake which occured following my chase email regarding papers With Editor last week 
You kindly sent a big list of referees for the papers you had on record and I did not check whether the papers were all in fact waiting for referees 
It turns out that this paper was actually with you for a decision not referee allocation 
One of the referees could not be reached anyway as their email did not respond Dr NAME but the other referee Dr NAME NAME NAME was chased for a response today 
I will obviously not chase this referee again as NUM reports have been received but I would be grateful to hear how you wish to proceed if the reviewer agrees to review 
Should I apologise and say that no further reports are needed or accept and wait for the review 
I look forward to hearing how you would like to deal with this matter

Notes to the Editor 
This paper concerns the adaptation of statistical language models by using relevant text material written in another language in conjunction with statistical machinetranslation techniques 
The subject and content of this paper is relevant interesting and wellpresented 
NUM point I do feel should be addressed before publication is chapter NUM NAME 
While this chapter contains interesting material it is not central to the main body of the paper and I feel it detracts from the focus of the work 
Furthermore the content is largely speculative since no results are reported 
I feel this material does not belong in the current publication and should simply be omitted 
My recommendation is for the publication in NAME of the submitted work subject to my previous comment 
With best regards NAME NAME

Notes to the authors 
The paper concerns topical work that is very interesting and well presented 
I have only NUM points of criticism the first of which I consider more important 
NUM Chapter NUM the Epilogue 
This chapter concerns the introduction of the notion of a crosslingual trigger and a discussion of how it may be incorporated into a language model using maximumentropy techniques 
This is highly interesting but not immediately relevant to the main body of the paper 
I feel this section should be omitted as it obscures the focus of the work presented in the first NUM sections and does not include any experimental evaluation 
Instead I suggest this be a topic of a separate future publication 
NUM The word contemporaneous plays a major role in your paper not least by its appearance in the title 
Since this word is as far as I am aware not in common use I would suggest a short initial explanation to clarify the context in which you are using it

preferably

issue to allocate to you 
I assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop

review 
and accept 
This looks to me like th quarter NUM or st quarter NUM 
CHAR A single issue of NAME will accommodate NUM or NUM papers 
To accommodate more we would have to make it a double issue 
How many papers do you anticipate accepting 
If you can answer the above then the editors can make a final decision 
Note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular 
submissions 
to NAME 
Each accepted paper must have been reviewed by NUM independent reviewers

Plant scientists today use NAME technology to answer questions such as What makes plants the shapes and colours they are 
How do they cope with pests and diseases 
How can we preserve biodiversity and use natural plant resources to find new medicines and other useful compounds NAME in the Garden uses living plant exhibits and interactive models to answer some of these questions and pose a lot more

Ordinary plants with extraordinary flowers How changes in NAME alter the shape of flowers 
Grass for all seasons selecting the right turf for football pitches farming golf courses and NUM other uses 
The classification game the problems and pitfalls of classifying plants and how NAME research is helping to solve these problems

The workshop is intended to address what we view as NUM central issues for the development of computational models of human language processing 
We feel these issues represent the current stumbling blocks to constructing the next generation of models and our aim is to hear concrete views on how to tackle these problems now and where research efforts should be directed in the medium term 
NUM Models of working memory in language processing to what extent does human working memory influence language processing behaviour are the mechanisms for language processing adapted to take memory constraints into account 
More generally how should theories of sentence processing be situated within and reconciled with more general accounts of cognitive processing and cognitive limitations 
NUM 
Broad coverage how can we develop psycholinguistic models that scale up in such a way that explains both high performance in general as well as the more pathological behaviours focused upon in psycholinguistic research 
What kinds of mechanisms statistical constraintbased and linguistic theories dependency generative incremental seem most promising for developing broad coverage models 
NUM 
Semantics in performance how can we extend current syntacticallybased accounts with implementable approximations of human semantic knowledge lexical sentential as well as plausibility

Hi Dr NAME 
I d like to do an intensive but parttime NAME 
My specific area of interest is the commercially useful analysis of business language text 
This may include for example analysis of political bias positive negative tone identification of recommendations and rating of risk 
I ve backgrounded myself already reading quite a few papers and books on sentiment classification and information extraction about to embark on machine learning 
I have no experience of academic linguistics but I have been an information architect in web systems for clients such as NAME NAME and News International 
I have a NUM degree in Civil Engineering NUM a NAME NAME NAME and NUM years experience in strategic marketing and business information systems 
I m currently NUM and a director in a growing web software company 
I wonder if you could give me some idea of CHAR my suitability to NAME CHAR whether I could work on a distance learning basis CHAR whether the timing of my application fits with the application schedule 
I have attached a summary of my interests below 
NAME regards

NUM RATIONALE Recent research in the areas of sentiment classification information extraction and machine learning applied to language processing has resulted in systems which can intelligently interpret documents with respect to particular tasks 
This work has achieved success rates which are scientifically significant indeed in some experimental applications success rates have approached those of humans 
Many researchers have created innovative techniques to harness a diverse range of text resources including search engines thesauri and internet content 
However we are still some way off the success rates of human interpretation in the commercial field 
Perhaps now is the right time to start the development of commercially satisfactory machine interpretation NAME which can achieve nearhuman interpretation within the wide limits of commercial applications 
Ultimately NAME s success will be measured by its adoption within the market 
Initially however the commercial market needs to exert its influence on this field and researchers need to understand commercial expectations to examine their implications on outputs and inputs and to develop viable trial systems 
This is where I wish to focus my attention 
NUM RESEARCH INTERESTS My research interests are in the applied ie commercially useful relationship between information extraction ie summarising key facts and sentiment classification 
In particular I am concerned with defining the potential applications of this relationship within a business context and in attempting to achieve a machineinterpretation accuracy which is acceptable to the market within a defined scope possibly close to human accuracy levels 
I wish to demonstrate that a single engine should be able to both perform and relate information extraction and sentiment classification simultaneously from natural language in common business use mainly through shallow techniques in machine learning 
Furthermore I hope to show that a typical business person should be able to operate such a system given a mixture of preconfigured and userdefined input parameters and achieve an accuracy which is high enough to satisfy commercial expectations perhaps over NUM 
For example I would hope that my work will contribute towards making the following activity possible a market analyst submits NUM articles from the Financial NAME on the footwear industry to an online service she enters the key topic areas of interest eg growth risk retail demand innovation Online service produces 
a summary of key facts and related author sentiments on these topics 
a clear statement of certainty on each area 
NUM PROPOSED RESEARCH I intend to conduct applied research into a modular system which contains the following components 
NUM NUM 
Sentiment selection by user NAME the resources and processes to enable users to select sentiments which will embrace CHAR user choice from predefined sentiments CHAR userdefined sentiments CHAR selecting multiple simultaneous sentiments 
NUM NUM 
Classifier data enrichment To support advanced polling of multiple classifiers CHAR simultaneous deployment of multiple classifiers eg Naive Vector Distance NAME Adjectiveadverb Phrase NAME CHAR generation of secondary data to record the certainty of the classification CHAR generation of tertiary data to enable the subsequent relating to information extraction CHAR creation of variants of known classifiers to enhance their application to business language CHAR possible development of thesaurusbased classifier as an addition to known classifiers CHAR customisation of inputs and outputs to NAME a typical business user 
NUM NUM 
Information extraction CHAR simultaneous deployment of multiple extractors eg Wrapper Induction NAME Pattern Matching Ontologybased Techniques CHAR generation of secondary data to record the certainty of the extraction CHAR generation of tertiary data to enable the subsequent relating to sentiment classification CHAR variation of known extractors to enhance their application to business language CHAR construction of common business concepts and lexicons CHAR customisation of inputs and outputs to NAME a typical business user 
NUM NUM 
Enhanced polling CHAR generating a commercially satisfactory correlation between result populations and polling harmony CHAR exploiting the classifier certainty and extractor certainty data derived from NUM and NUM above CHAR simultaneously delivering dependent and independent results for classifier and extractor polling 
NUM NUM

Special Issue on Grammatical Inference Techniques Applications 
This Special Issue will be published in April NUM to commemorate and NAME the memory of Late Professor NAME NAME NAME 
Grammatical Inference GI is a collection of methodologies for learning grammars from training data 
The most traditional field of application of NAME has been syntactic pattern recognition 
In the recent past however concerted efforts from diverse disciplines to find tractable inference techniques have added new dimensions and opened up unchartered territories 
Applications of NAME in more nontraditional fields include NAME NAME NAME NAME NAME and Information Retrieval 
Development of algorithms for NAME has evolved over the years from dealing with only positive training samples to more fundamental efforts that try to circumvent the lack of negative samples This idea is pursued in stochastic grammars and languages which attempt to overcome absence of negative samples by gathering statistical information from available positive samples 
Also within the framework of information theory probability estimation technique for NAME NAME Model known as NAME and for ContextFree language the InsideOutside algorithm are focal point of investigations in stochastic grammar field 
Techniques that use intelligent search to infer the rules of grammar are showing considerable promise 
Recently there has been a surge of activities dealing with specialized neural network architecture and dedicated learning algorithms to approach NAME problems 
In more customary track research in learning classes of transducers continue to arouse interests in NAME community 
Close interaction collaboration between different disciplines and availability of powerful computers are fueling novel research efforts in NAME 
The objective of the Special Issue is to present the current status of this topic through the works of researchers in different disciplines 
Original and tutorial papers are solicited that address theoretical and practical issues on this theme 
Topics of interest include but are not limited to 
NAME Neural network framework and learning algorithms geared to NAME NAME via heuristic and genetic search Inference mechanisms for stochastic grammars languages Algebraic methods for identification of languages NAME learning 
NAME Image processing and computer vision Biosequence analysis and prediction Speech and natural language processing Data mining information retrieval Optical character recognition 
NAME NAME Only electronic ftp submission will be accepted 
Instructions for submission of papers can be found at the guest editor s web site WEBSITE 
All submitted papers will be reviewed according to guidelines and standards of Pattern Recognition

NAME NAME 
How is NAME going to work if people do nt people know where to put comma CHAR 
NAME ha well I m certainly not going to go through the files correcting grammar 
Certainly introducing the spurious semicolons will seriously confuse the parser so doing a global sub using CHAR awk or sed before parsing wld help 
Okay I ll try that and see how many CHAR fragx and CHAR s I m left with 
We cld try asking for a better version from NAME or a MUCrelated discussion list 
Send me all the details you have and I ll follow it up 
Version NUM of the scorer used for the formal test appears to install NAME but it s version NUM for the dry run that s problematic 
I ve yet to test actually using version NUM 
though 
Here s the error messages I get when following the install instructions 
E 
fang MUCscorer make install cd src make NAME bin install Nfs elmere homes ar unixhome project muc NAME MUCscorer NAME NAME src make NUM Entering directory Nfs elmere homes ar unixhome project muc NAME MUCscorer MU Cscorer src gcc CHAR DSCCSID lconfigc 
l configc NUM initializer element is not constant 
l configc NUM initializer element is not constant make NUM lconfigo Error NUM make NUM Leaving directory Nfs elmere homes ar unixhome project muc NAME MUCscorer MU Cscorer src make install Error NUM 
E and NAME NAME s reply to my query 
The install sequence is failing on the line gcc CHAR DSCCSID lconfigc 
ie the C compiler is producing a syntax error when it tries to compile the file lconfigc in your project muc NAME MUCscorer MUCscorer src directory 
specifically it is failing on line NUM FILE configin NUM stdin configout NUM stdout 
because stdin and stdout is defined previously in such a way that the compiler does nt know that it is a constant and as this line is a definition this is an error because you cannot define something to be equal to something else that is nt known at compile time 
Or to summarise with our CHAR compiler this is an error 
The writer of the software presumably has a compiler which allows this sort of construct 
You ll either have to complain to whoever wrote the software or find a CHAR expert willing to figure out how to rewrite the file such that our compiler allows it

Re Fwd NAME studentship applications

<BODY>
I have asked that the Board extend the deadline to the end of April for NAME students to pick up on the fact that a lot of mail is being scanned slowing up delivery to the NAME considerably 
We can therefore advertise the fact that fulltime students have an extension until April th that ll allow for the incredible backlog at the NAME and some breathing space for applications posted before April th to arrive 
Parttimers can apply up until July st directly to me 
Thanks NAME 
NAME 
NAME does this mean that ORG will not accept NAME aplications after the deadline 
If they wo nt we should nt say anythiong 
If they will accept applicants we could put April th as the revised deadline 
Can you make it clear on the website that the deadline applies to the fulltime applicants given the status of the parttime applicants we should be willing to accept people significantly later July st is fine having just got your email thanks NAME

TITLE Opening up the Kernel to rd Parties 
For safety reasons most modern operating systems allow only users with the highest privileges root users to program the kernel directly 
However there exist many application areas eg in network packet processing where rd party code would benefit from the ability to execute below the kernel boundary 
In the Open Kernel Environment NAME we allow any party with the appropriate credentials to load fully optimised native code in a safe manner in the heart of the NAME kernel 
Depending on the credentials the code will get more or less access to resources such as NAME time heap stack NAME etc The restrictions are enforced by a trusted compiler 
In other words the NAME offers a safe and flexible environment for programming the kernel 
In this talk I will give an overview of the NAME and of the mechanisms that were used to restrict the modules

NAME Loglinear models with priors

In several articles I have read I found the authors using loglinear models with priors usually a Gaussian prior in order to perform smoothing or to eliminate the possibility of infinitely large weights

Re workplan
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Hi 
I have been trying to come to some sensible conclusions about which topic codes to select 
Given some basic assumptions 
NUM It would be nice to have several granularities of classification available in order to investigate performance thoroughly 
NUM Issues of data sparsity should be avoided if possible hence large training set 
NUM Using similar data to NAME would save time and effort 
NUM Building on or at least comparing to NAME NAME s work might be beneficial 
It seems sensible to mimic what NAME is thinking of doing and make use of the CHAR and CHAR topic hierarchies 
The CHAR hierarchy provides both fine and medium granularities the use of both CHAR and CHAR gives a coarse classification problem 
There are many documents in each hierarchy tempering any data sparsity problems 
In fact there are probably too many documents in the CHAR hierarchy especially and so perhaps only a subset should be used for example the C documents and not the C C etc 
Does this seem sensible to you 
I have shell scripts running that retrieve the zip file and xml file name of each document belonging to each hierarchy but they take an extremely long time to run 
Also in his writeup NAME NAME says that some documents are assigned a subtopic without being assigned the corresponding parent eg C without NAME it seems to me that these should be taken as implied where they are not present but that may not be correct 
Thanks

Re proposal
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
Things have been a bit hectic lately eg I stupidly promised NAME to go and give a talk in his MEANING workshop before I realised that they want me to give plenty of feedback on their project as well but I have managed to work on the NAME and NAME proposals 
I think the proposals are now better but I would be grateful if you had a quick look 
I left them in your pigeon hole in an envelope 
They ended up being quite similar in terms of the overall goal 
They both propose developing a system for automatic largescale domainspecific verb classification building on the extant technology rasp parser subcat extraction NAME clustering and improving expanding on this where needed and using the final version of this system to acquire a large domainindependent classification for verbs which will be made available for public use along with the software which can be used to tune it specific to domains tasks 
They differ in that 
NUM NAME proposal involves experimenting with what kind of linguistically interesting novel information aside verb classes we can acquire from corpus data using our technology 
Where possible this information will be incorporated into the final resource I build 
NUM NAME proposal is technically a bit more ambitious it concentrates on extracting verb classes and class participants no other novel info and involves developing a new taskbased evaluation in the context of event extraction 
If you feel they are not different enough I ll then change modify them further 
Also I am happy to improve them further where required 
NAME does nt have any deadlines but it would be good to submit asap so that the proposal will get to the July board 
I just received NUM successful fellowship proposals to look at so I will also be able to submit the fellowship prop 
soon 
I think you mentioned I could submit the NAME proposal to the Research in the Fundamental Computer Science for eScience scheme 
The deadline for that is this month NUM 
I have already asked NAME to calculate my salary so I can in principle start to fill in the application forms 
However I ll first wait and see if you think these proposals are ok because I need to make all kinds of aims and objectives summaries in the application form 
Then there are bits that you probably need to look at but I ll get back to you about those later 
Many thanks NAME

Re Multilingual text categorisation
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
I made experiments on the NUM approaches and according to obtained results the second solution perfomes well 
Therefore the introduction of machine translation in the process of categorization helps to recognize the subject of a text 
The second solution seems yield more training examples for the single classifier although the texts may be noisy but the labels are correct 
So it may be due to these more training examples that improve the performance 
The translator as long as it is not too bad plays less role in this case 
This is just my conjecture

NAME tracking system
</SUBJECT>
<BODY>
A few people have spotted the evidence that we have started using a problem tracking system for dealing with queries to the system administrators 
Although the system should be largely transparent this is just a quick note to explain what is going on and how you can help the system to run smoothly 
A problem with support addresses such as sysadmin is that of ensuring that every problem is dealt with by somebody and that we try to avoid wasted effort by having more than NUM person pick up the same message 
A secondary problem is that of keeping track of the correspondence for a longrunning problem especially when responsibility is transferred from NUM person to another 
We are therefore experimenting with a problem tracking system called WEBSITE 
Whenever a problem enters the system is is assigned a unique ticket number which is put into the subject line of all further correspondence 
You can help the system run smoothly by observing these guidelines 
Please try to confine an initial message to a single problem or very closely related problems 
If you put completely unrelated matters in a single message it may be difficult to handle them in parallel or a supplementary question may be missed 
If you want to add some correspondence to an existing query always reply to a message which includes the ticket number if you have one 
We will shortly be arranging that an automatic reply is sent out when a ticket is created 
If you want to add more information before you have had a reply from a human you can reply to this 
The system is being introduced gradually so in the short term you may find that some questions are answered the old way whilst others are given tickets 
When we believe a ticket has been resolved you should get a message saying so 
If you agree do nothing 
If you disagree either immediately or after some time replying to a message which has the ticket number will automatically reopen it with the advantage that we will be able to see the previous correspondence instantly

Please make my job easier by replying promptly
